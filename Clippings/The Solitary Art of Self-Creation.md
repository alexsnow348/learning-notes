## Questions to ask for yourself

> “The whole life of the individual is nothing but the process of giving birth to himself; indeed, we should be fully born when we die — although it is the tragic fate of most individuals to die before they are born.”

 — **Erich Fromm**
 
- Are you satisfied with who you are and what you’ve attained in life? 
- Can you look yourself in the mirror in the early hours of dawn and honestly answer that question?
- Have you carved out a life true to who you are beyond the job, the title, the possessions, and society's tedious obligations? 
- Have you ever accomplished anything on your own terms to be truly proud of?
- Have you achieved some aspect of personal excellence through the cultivation of your own creative powers? Or are you simply living out your life as a walking mimicry, relying on customs, fashions, false appearances, and the opinions of others to nourish your sense of self-worth?

## The Top Five Regrets of the Dying

1) “I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.”
2) “I wish I hadn't worked so hard.”
3) “I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.” 
4) “I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.” 
5) “I wish I had let myself be happier.”


To become the artist of your life is to forever seek the light and resist being marred by the endless mire of this batshit crazy world. 
It is to be inventive, daring, well-read, and untamed in your quest. Give attention to the hunger of your soul. Explore the full range of your own potentialities and suppressed passions.
