“What kind of person should you aspire to be?”

- “our personal inclinations and dispositions (which result from our genetic and evolutionary inheritance); our family and its values; any religious or philosophical traditions we might ascribe to; our friends and peers; and the suggestions of our social, economic, political, and cultural structures and norms”
- “the family we are born into might influence how religious we are (either because we follow or we rebel), and the religion itself might change over the years as it is affected by popular culture, which itself is likely shaped by economic interests.”
- “the pressure to be great, which is to say, to maximize our potential and be at the top of our field. ”


“From Buddhism we can learn that although some suffering in life is inevitable, the best path to decreasing it is through embracing our interdependence”

“that winning is a leaky cup: the more we get, the more we want. There’s always another promotion or accomplishment around the bend. Community and kindness, however, tend to have long-lasting benefits”
