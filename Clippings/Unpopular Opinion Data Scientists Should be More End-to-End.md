- I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end.
- An end-to-end data scientist can **identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value**.

Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:
- What is the problem? Why is it important?
- Can we solve it? How should we solve it?
- What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?

**For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction**, which is [closely tied](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/how-employees-are-motivated-autonomy-mastery-purpose/) to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

- **Autonomy:** By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.
- **Mastery:** In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.
- **Purpose**: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of _purpose_.
