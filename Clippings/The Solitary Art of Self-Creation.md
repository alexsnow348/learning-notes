> “The whole life of the individual is nothing but the process of giving birth to himself; indeed, we should be fully born when we die — although it is the tragic fate of most individuals to die before they are born.”

 — **Erich Fromm**
 
- Are you satisfied with who you are and what you’ve attained in life? 
- Can you look yourself in the mirror in the early hours of dawn and honestly answer that question?
- Have you carved out a life true to who you are beyond the job, the title, the possessions, and society's tedious obligations? 
- Have you ever accomplished anything on your own terms to be truly proud of?
- Have you achieved some aspect of personal excellence through the cultivation of your own creative powers? Or are you simply living out your life as a walking mimicry, relying on customs, fashions, false appearances, and the opinions of others to nourish your sense of self-worth?
