# How to Get Rich
---

It is merely a question of education and desire. You have to want it. If you don’t want it, that’s fine.

A lot of people think making money is about luck. It’s not. It’s about becoming the kind of person that makes money.

Where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, where then luck finds you.

It’s more about consistently creating wealth by creating businesses, including opportunities and creating investments. It hasn’t been a giant one-off thing.

He’s building videos. It’s not like any one video is going to suddenly shower him with riches overnight. It’s going to be a long lifetime of learning, of reading, of creating that’s going to compound.

## **Build your character so opportunity finds you**

Because the world is a very efficient place, so, everyone has dug through all the obvious places to dig and so to find something that’s new and novel and uncovered, it helps to be operating on a frontier.
Where right there you have to be a little eccentric to be out on the frontier by yourself, and then you have to be willing to dig deeper than other people do, deeper than seems rational just because you’re interested.

## **You want a career where your inputs don’t match your outputs**

So, you want to look for professions and careers where the inputs and outputs are highly disconnected. This is another way of saying that you want to look for things that are leveraged.

Tools and leverage are what create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. Creativity, so the higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs

## **People living below their means have freedom**

people who are living far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles just can’t fathom.

The way you want to get wealthy is you want to be poor, and working, and working, and working.

## **Give society what it wants, but doesn’t know how to get—at scale**

**Figure out what product you can provide and then figure out how to scale it**

First it starts as an act of creativity. First you create it just because you want it. You want it, and you know how to build it, and you need it. And so you build it for yourself. Then you figure out how to get it to other people. And then for a little while rich people have it. It’s about distributing what rich people used to have to everybody.

Entrepreneurship is essentially an act of creating something new from scratch. Predicting that society will want it, and then figuring out how to scale it, and get it to everybody in a profitable way, in a self-sustaining way.

## The Internet Has Massively Broadened Career Possibilities

**The Internet allows you to scale any niche obsession**

You can go out on the internet, and you can find your audience. And you can build a business, and create a product, and build wealth, and make people happy just uniquely expressing yourself through the internet.

**Escape competition through authenticity**

Don’t imitate. Don’t copy. Just do your own thing. No one can compete with you on being you. It’s that simple.

so the more authentic you are to who you are, and what you love to do, the less competition you’re gonna have. So, you can escape competition through authenticity when you realize that no one can compete with you on being you.
