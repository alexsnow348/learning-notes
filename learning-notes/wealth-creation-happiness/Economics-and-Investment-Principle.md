## Economics Principle 

- Short / long term debt cycle 
	- credit is buying power
	- debt is commitment to payback
- Politics - US vs China

## Three Important Equilibriums

 - Debt growth is ***in line*** with the income growth that is required to service debts
 - Economic capacity utilisation is neither ***too high nor too low***
 - Projected returns of **equities**(stock) are above the projected returns of **bonds** which are above the projected returns of **cash** by appropriate risk premiums - ***cash < bonds < equities***
## Two Levers

- Monetary Policy - brakes/gas put on - tight/lose
- Fiscal Policy 
Economic and market movements are like perpetual motion machine of the interactions of these.

## Reserve Currency Status

- How they gain/lose their reserve currency status - Dutch, UK, US, China 
	- innovation + tech + competition
## Investment Principles

- The theoretical value equals the present value of the future cash flow - every investment is a lump sum payment for a future cash flow
- how much it is gonna spend and what are the motivation of the spenders
- Assets are priced lo discount future expectations, so when inflation, growth, risk premia and discount rates change, assets prices change
- ﻿﻿Every investment is a return stream
- ﻿﻿Diversification can reduce risk more than il reduces returns so it improves relurn-to-risk ratio
- ﻿﻿Return streams can be either betas or alphas
- ﻿﻿The key to good investing is to create good portfolios of good return streams
- ﻿﻿Return streams can be risk adjusted to be risk balanced
- ﻿﻿The holy grail of investing is finding 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams
- ﻿﻿Systemise decision making, rules should be limetess and universal
