There are no foreign lands. It is the traveller only who is foreign.

I decided on an experiment. Rather than go straight to a painting’s blurb as I usually do, I would look at a painting unguided, without rails or assistance as it were, and provide my own story. Looking at paintings is visual, emotional, psychological. Titles are in some ways irrelevant and often the curator’s blurb is a distraction which stands in the way of one’s own understanding. It was like going on a solitary journey where I was able to see and hear and feel what I wanted to.
