6100	8660	For years, I've sounded like a broken record.
9040	10400	I do not want kids.
10560	11820	I do not ever want to have kids.
11900	14120	I don't want to have a kid, don't want to have a kid, don't want to have a kid.
14680	17460	I'm in my 40s now. The door is almost closed.
18160	20340	And suddenly, I'm not so sure.
21080	23200	The story has always been no.
23840	27180	I'm just wondering to what degree it's just a story.
27960	29020	Definitely just a story.
29020	32920	From CBC's Personally, this is Creation Myth.
33440	35680	Available now wherever you get your podcasts.
59020	65960	And their victims were the Druids, an ancient religious order which was ruthlessly eliminated from Roman Britain.
65960	70620	The Druids were active in Britain, Ireland and Gaul and flourished for many centuries.
71140	76260	They were reasonably well chronicled by ancient authors including Julius Caesar and Posidonius.
76880	81940	Much later, thanks to a revival of interest in the 17th century, they inspired a wealth of literature and art.
81940	90640	But because the Druids were an oral culture and left no written records of their own, comparatively little is known about their beliefs and practices.
91160	97040	And the reinventions of the Druidical traditions by Romantic writers have resulted in much misconception and myth.
97040	104760	With me to discuss the ancient Druids are Justin Champion, Professor of the History of Early Modern Ideas at Royal Holloway, University of London.
105360	109740	Barry Cunliffe, Emeritus Professor of European Archaeology at the University of Oxford.
110160	114480	And Miranda Oldhouse-Green, Professor of Archaeology at Cardiff University.
114980	118640	Justin Champion, who were the Druids and where did they live?
118640	125540	The Druids really, I think, flourished between the late 4th century BC and the end of the 2nd century AD.
125980	130760	They're predominantly map onto the late Iron Age culture called Latin.
131880	138360	They're very eminent in England, in Britain, in Wales and in Brittany, in Gaul.
138920	140520	So they cover that period.
140520	147480	The problem we have is that the sources, the literary sources that expose their traditions are very, very fragmentary.
147480	150420	They're palimpsests, written over earlier traditions.
151040	154980	We know Druids existed in this culture because we can look at place names.
155100	157240	We can look at the spread of Celtic language.
157660	160860	But actually identifying the key areas is quite difficult.
161620	165480	One of the problems we have is that they were a determinedly oral culture.
165760	169860	Can you tell us why they were and what the consequence of that is?
170240	173820	Well, one of the problems is that they are a priesthood of some sort.
173820	180440	And they believe that they understand deep secret knowledge and that they pass it on to people of their own ilk.
180920	189740	That means that they don't leave artifacts and texts for us to study as modern historians and archaeologists.
189880	202140	And one of the problems is, is trying to coordinate the reportage of Druids in figures like Caesar and Pliny later with some of the archaeological temples and buildings that we know.
202140	209880	And certainly later on in the period, the 17th and 18th century, there's huge amounts of speculation about connecting that oral culture.
210380	218540	Of course, there are traditions in the early medieval periods that somehow draw from an oral tradition, particularly in Ireland.
218920	223240	And those, again, are exploited by 17th and 18th century figures.
223240	225800	But it's a very, very mysterious business.
226080	230400	Can we just go back for a moment or two, just not go back, go to this oral tradition idea?
230540	238860	Because many, many civilizations are remote from us because of their insistence on an oral tradition, which is fascinating.
239460	240660	You said they were priesthood.
240720	242040	They wanted to keep it among themselves.
242380	247540	But in a way, I think it I've read anyway, it's more extensive and deeper than that.
247620	249260	Can you just dwell on that for a moment or two?
249260	259680	I think one of the things that we we have difficulty with is, of course, Christianity became so dominant, even in the early centuries after Christ.
259860	268460	And that one of the projects that the Roman Empire alongside Christianity has was to actually obscure many, many aspects of that oral culture.
268520	269880	It has to be sort of destroyed.
270040	272140	It hasn't got to the point of why they insisted on it.
272140	280780	I've read it's because they thought that the writing was lazy, that they thought that writing was open to misinterpretations, which oral culture wasn't.
281240	282520	And are these any explanations?
282520	284740	Those are good, plausible explanations.
285200	294780	And certainly the Druids, because they read nature, they read sort of deeper philosophy, want to be able to communicate effectively with their local communities.
294780	299900	And, of course, writing is open to rhetoric and to exploitation.
300120	310780	There is one tradition, though, that says Druid thinking is captured in this mysterious language called Ogham, little marks on wooden sticks and on stones.
310920	314280	But, of course, we don't actually know very much about Ogham script itself.
314540	320220	And the invention of an oral tradition captured in that form is very much a 17th century tradition.
320220	325560	Barry Cunliffe, can you tell us then about the earliest chronicled references to the Druids?
326080	332920	Well, as Justin said, we've got lots of snippets of information about the Druids spread across a number of classical writers.
333940	344220	But from about the 1st century BC to about the 7th century AD, most of those classical writers are quoting secondhand, thirdhand, fourthhand from other classical writers.
344220	354580	So the game, really, is to try and sort out when the first and when the inputs of new information about the Druids sort of hit the literary world.
355160	370960	I think one could argue that the first input of real information comes around 300 BC with the journeys of a very remarkable man called Pythias who lived in Marseille.
370960	376020	He was a Greek. And he made a journey. We know about this journey.
376100	379540	He made a journey. I think he was trying to work out where the tin came from.
379640	383360	Tin was very important for the Greek economy. And it was coming from the northwest.
383920	398780	So he traveled through France, got into the Atlantic, probably took local boats, went to Brittany, crossed to Cornwall, up the Irish Sea, to the Northern Isles, down the east coast of Britain, down the Channel, and back to Brittany.
398780	402800	Back to Marseille, where he wrote a book called On the Ocean.
403440	412880	Now, that was the main source of information about the northwest of Europe, the Atlantic shores of Europe.
413420	415420	And that book, On the Ocean, we don't have.
415780	418560	But lots of other people started to use it as a source.
418700	421780	People like Timaeus, who was a Sicilian historian.
421780	430580	And people like Eratosthenes, a very interesting man around 200 BC, he was the librarian, chief librarian at Alexandria.
431160	434860	And people like that were using this early source.
434860	436560	And what were they finding about Druids in his account?
436660	438660	They were finding a lot about Britain.
439240	442880	And they were picking up little snippets of information about Druids.
442880	449280	And particularly, the theme that comes over is Druids as philosophers, as natural philosophers.
449760	453900	This is the early, let's call this the early Greek tradition, the Greek or Alexandrian tradition.
454420	459580	And that really does focus, not on all the ritual and blood and things like that.
459740	463300	It focuses on the intellectual quality of the Druid.
463620	465140	And the Greeks were very impressed.
465260	467700	They compared Druids rather to Pythagoras.
467700	475020	And Druids had these strange ideas that the soul was immortal, and so on.
475220	480080	Did Posidonius later, was it two centuries later, did he take up, did he build on Pythagoras' ideas?
480180	482760	He was an anthropologist, or did he do some original work of his own?
482880	486020	No, Posidonius was the next sort of input of new information.
486360	492080	Posidonius was a Stoic philosopher from Apamea in Syria.
492080	492740	He was Greek.
493140	500260	But he spent most of his time on the island of Rhodes, in the sort of university atmosphere of Rhodes.
500540	503000	But he was writing a history of the ancient world.
503340	506080	And like a good historian, he actually did his fieldwork.
506160	510180	And one of the bits of fieldwork he did was to go to southern France, Gaul,
510740	515500	when just a generation after the Romans had just taken over that southern strip of France,
516020	519760	ostensibly to work out how Hannibal got through the Alps and so on.
519800	520700	He was writing about that.
520700	525840	And he came across Celts and observed the habits of the Celts and the Druids and so on.
526100	528760	And he put a lot of new information into the pot.
529400	531580	What are the likely origins, the deep origins?
531740	536380	You've mentioned Pythagoras, the claims that it goes back to Moses, 13th century BC,
536560	539580	that it even goes back to Egypt, the Druid tradition.
539760	541240	Now, what are we to make of that?
541340	543440	What do you see as the origins?
544260	546100	Well, I think I can just take the evidence.
546100	556840	And what we've got to live with is a remark by Julius Caesar that the Druids originated in Britain.
557200	560200	And if you want to study the Druids, you've got to go to Britain to do so.
560640	563000	Now, we don't have to believe everything Caesar says.
563020	566980	Why did this business of Egypt, Moses and Pythagoras come in then?
566980	572080	Well, it was the later Greek writers who were looking back...
572080	573380	Was it Strabo and people like that?
573380	580100	No, people like Clement of Alexandria and some of the later Christians looking back on this
580100	588240	and saying that really the beliefs of the Druids were so much like Pythagoras
588240	593060	that either Pythagoras got them from the Druids or the other way around.
593100	595480	Belief being the transmigration of the cell, for instance.
595620	596800	That's right, that sort of thing.
597680	604340	But where the origin of the Druid belief came from, as Justin said,
604500	608220	it's concentrated in Britain, Ireland and France.
608840	611940	And that's where most of the place names, most of the evidence is.
611940	618240	And I think if you look, take Caesar's view that they might have originated in Britain.
619160	621300	Caesar, can I go across to Miranda for Caesar, Barry?
621500	621820	Do you mind?
622160	629100	Miranda, so we've got Caesar who gives us a very, quite a detailed account,
629260	630200	chronicle of the Druids.
630280	632220	Can you just tell listeners what he says about them?
632760	632920	Yes.
633320	636160	We take it he's a reasonably reliable historian.
636260	637100	He was on the case.
637160	638360	He was in Gaul for eight years.
638440	639880	He knew about this country as well.
639880	643640	Yes, he was in Gaul for about sort of eight or nine years in the 50s BC.
644560	650120	He was a Roman general and he wrote a war commentary called the Gallic Wars or De Bello Gallico.
651260	657100	And he, most of the books, there are seven books written by him in his lifetime and then one posthumous one.
657880	662280	But in book six, he digresses from his normal war diaries where he's talking about, you know,
662320	664340	conquering different tribes and polities in Gaul.
664340	671200	And he digresses to talk about customs and practices of Gauls and Germans and Britons to an extent.
672200	678180	And there's a quite a long piece in book six about the society in Gaul at the time he was writing.
678920	683260	And he says very tellingly that there were only two lots of people of any account, the Knights and the Druids.
683260	686420	And he's obviously far more interested in the Druids than anybody else.
686940	694160	He says they're in charge of all religious practices, that they are judges, they are teachers, they are natural scientists, they study the cosmos.
694920	699580	And they were immensely influential in all political and religious matters.
700540	702980	And Caesar is quite clearly quite impressed with them.
702980	710620	We learned later on, or not actually, but earlier on in the commentaries, that he had a very good friend called Diviciarchus,
710900	713720	who was the leader of a Burgundian tribe called the Aedui.
715040	717620	It's a Romanised name of a Celt.
717820	720360	Of a Celtic tribe, Diviciarchus, yes, indeed.
720840	725100	And he was a leader, but he was also in charge of religion.
725100	736180	And Cicero picks up Diviciarchus, who visited Rome in 60 BC, and Cicero meets him and talks about what an impressive person he is
736180	740740	and how good he is at divining the future, how good he is at augury, and he was a Druid.
741500	746400	So Caesar has this powerful ally, Diviciarchus, whom Cicero picks up on.
746400	756380	And the general impression you get from Caesar is that they are impressive intellectuals, they are worthy of Caesar's interest.
757400	763580	He also picks up on this business about oral tradition, Caesar, and he says quite clearly there are two reasons for lack of writing.
764100	767800	One is secrecy and the need to keep knowledge to the few.
768560	771620	And the second is to train memory.
771620	777800	And I think the whole idea about the Druids is that they are keepers of ancestral tradition.
778320	782280	They are, in a sense, the keepers of the culture of the communities in which they operated.
783000	784480	Is there any corroboration?
784580	791540	I mean, the interesting thing about Caesar's chronicle, apart from its interest, from what he says, is that it is detailed.
791620	793020	He claims an awful lot.
793380	795440	He makes a very grand claim for the Druids.
795800	797200	Is there any corroboration?
797360	797980	Is he alone?
798240	800240	What reasons do you have for believing him?
800240	809680	I think partly because he was surrounded by fellow Romans of similar status to himself.
810500	817820	He was writing his commentaries specifically to justify what were slightly dodgy actions in Gaul.
817980	820880	He didn't really have a mandate from the Senate for what he was doing in Gaul.
821560	825720	And I think part of the commentaries, part of the purpose of the commentaries was to legitimize what he was doing.
826340	829020	But he had people with him like Cicero's brother Quintus.
829020	835940	And I think had he sort of made it all up, I think people might have actually rumbled him and said something.
836540	843360	So although some of it may be sort of flannel and embroidery, I think he's one of our best sources.
843360	850380	Because the great thing about Caesar is he's writing at the time when the Druids were particularly prevalent.
850380	858120	What evidence did he put forward, if he put forward any evidence, that this had begun, the origin of the thing in north-west Europe was in Britain?
858800	864660	He actually says it is thought that Druidry began in Britain and was exported to Gaul.
864940	869160	And that's actually quite interesting because later on Pliny, who's another source of the Druids...
869160	869260	Pliny the Elder.
869480	872180	Pliny the Elder actually says exactly the opposite.
873300	874260	So who knows?
874260	879600	After Caesar, are there any classical authors who are as detailed and as convincing?
880560	884640	Not as detailed, but Pliny is quite...
884640	885400	He's quite interesting.
885820	892040	The later writers in the 1st century AD, there's a subtle change in how Druids are regarded by Romans.
892920	895360	So Caesar is fairly complementary about them.
895720	900560	People like Pliny, Tacitus and Lucan in the 1st century AD are fairly anti them.
900560	906640	And what you're getting now is the barbarian, the savage, human sacrifices talked up.
906920	911300	Is it propaganda or do you think it's a more realistic, more truthful analysis?
911980	914280	Well, a bit of both, I think.
914520	915720	Because the Romans didn't...
915720	918900	We're coming to that, but the Romans found the Druids an obstacle when they came to this country.
919240	923740	I think, yes, I think the Romans found the Druids a bit of a pain, partly because they were very highly nationalistic
923740	928760	and were clearly focuses of sedition and rebellion.
928760	933600	So when you are annexing a province, the last thing you want is Druids in people's ears going,
933720	934560	no, we don't want that.
934760	938120	And, of course, it's in the Druids' best interests for Rome not to succeed
938120	940320	because the whole of their power base would go.
940960	946760	Druids' power depends upon Gallic society and British society being hierarchical, highly stratified.
947120	951620	Once you bring Romans into the mix, the whole of society falls apart and is reinvented.
951700	953100	And there is no place for Druids in that.
953320	955200	So we're talking about the beginnings of a sort of propaganda.
955200	960660	And before we move on, when you say Davidiacus, Davidiacus met Cicero in Rome,
960740	962020	which language did they speak in?
962360	963160	Ah, Latin.
963620	963840	Right.
964420	965540	So the Druids knew Latin.
965900	966160	OK.
966920	967540	Well, enough.
967940	970080	If you can talk to Cicero, you're not doing badly.
970080	970800	No, indeed not.
971360	971740	OK.
972260	976940	Justin, Justin Champion, let's develop the idea of the Druids in society in Britain.
976940	978840	And we know quite a bit now.
978980	980600	So you just developed that.
980700	981640	How powerful were they?
981840	983580	The word power has been mentioned by Miranda.
983900	989240	I think, once again, we've got to be very cautious because we're drawing from these little fragments of sources
989240	990620	and sort of stitching them together.
990820	994440	You know, if we believe Caesar, the Druids are very highly organised.
994660	995860	You know, they have annual meetings.
996040	997120	They're arch-Druids.
997120	1002160	They elect, they sort of confer and communicate across Gaul and Britain.
1003180	1011960	Within those societies, though, as Miranda said, that they are judges, they're teachers, they're motivators in some sense.
1012000	1015220	And I think that's one of the reasons why the Romans have difficulties with them.
1015480	1020500	The doctrine of the transmigration of the souls, I think it's Caesar says, makes men very brave.
1020860	1027040	Because if you know you may come back, then you're not going to be afraid to die in a war defending your own sort of community.
1027120	1032200	So I think we can think of the Druids as experts.
1032980	1035220	You know, they're not quite priests.
1035360	1036440	They're more than priests.
1037500	1045320	Certainly, as Pliny and the later sources expound and embroider on, they're involved with medical practice.
1045600	1046660	They're judges.
1046960	1050760	They're people who will negotiate between strife within communities.
1050900	1052260	So they're very powerful figures.
1052440	1055420	Caesar describes two sorts, knights and Druids.
1055420	1065800	Certainly, I think, after the Christian era, Druids are more and more marginalised and are starting to be thought of as sort of slightly odd magicians.
1065980	1068740	You know, they retreat, perhaps, out of communities.
1069520	1075600	So they're very powerful figures that we don't quite have a modern equivalent for, I think.
1075600	1082660	What do we know about the Druids' beliefs and rituals, then, Barry Cunner?
1083760	1085340	Well, strangely, very little.
1085960	1087660	We can pick up bits of it.
1088600	1090980	The Druid has...
1090980	1097500	If you're communicating as an ordinary person with the gods, you can only do so through the Druid.
1097500	1099320	So the Druid is an intermediary to start with.
1099320	1100040	So I want you to...
1100040	1102380	That's one point I was hesitating, stumbling off.
1102640	1103180	We're just in there.
1103440	1104360	But let's take it with you.
1105060	1112020	Was it a prime source of their power that they were, your word, the intermediaries between the gods and the...
1112020	1112820	They could do it.
1112880	1114000	They could take you to God.
1114080	1116900	They could tell you what God wanted to do and what God was going to do.
1116940	1119160	And that was the real keystone of their power.
1119280	1119960	Absolutely right.
1119960	1130480	As it is of most priesthoods, the priesthoods maintain their power because you, as an ordinary person, can't communicate with the gods without their presence.
1131040	1133960	And Caesar actually is quite specific about this.
1134020	1139860	He says that they can prevent you from communicating with the gods.
1140060	1142380	In other words, excommunicate you.
1142780	1146640	And no one will speak to you and you'll just fall apart and have to go away.
1146640	1152920	So they have immense power because they are the only way that you can contact the gods.
1153760	1159480	So you say we don't know much about their beliefs, but Christians began to claim that they, in some ways, prefigured Christianity.
1160540	1161680	Was that much later?
1162280	1166860	Yes, that comes later when people are trying to bring these two things together.
1167580	1171400	But we see them as the intermediaries.
1171760	1173720	There is one famous bit of ritual.
1173720	1180200	In fact, it's the only decent bit of ritual we've got, which Pliny talks about, which is the famous cutting of the mistletoe with a golden sickle.
1180920	1188120	And he explains this in quite a lot of detail, how you have to have the right time of the moon.
1188260	1189700	The moon mustn't be too strong.
1189840	1190780	It mustn't be too weak.
1190860	1192040	So you choose your time.
1192400	1202100	And that's one of the other aspects of the Druids' control, that they controlled our knowledge of time, when is an appropriate time to do things, when isn't an appropriate time to do things.
1202100	1203440	Very powerful, that is.
1204240	1208620	And then you had to dress in, the priest had to dress in white robes.
1209620	1213080	The mistletoe growing on the oak was particularly powerful.
1213660	1215940	And you cut it with a golden sickle.
1216160	1217300	It fell on a white cloth.
1217700	1219740	You sacrificed white oxen and so on.
1219920	1224360	So you get a sense of the complexity of belief and ritual there.
1224360	1224940	Why mistletoe?
1226580	1232880	I don't know what the particular power of mistletoe is, but the power of their belief in it was obviously very strong.
1233120	1234520	They said it was all curing.
1234920	1243860	But they also, and the same bit of Pliny, shows how very important their knowledge of plant law was and healing and the science of plants.
1244380	1246560	So we just get that little glimpse from Pliny.
1246560	1248380	Miranda, I'll just screen.
1248500	1252880	What was the, let's talk about the Druids now and the occupying Roman power.
1253100	1253900	In come the Romans.
1255000	1255920	There are the Druids.
1256560	1257460	There's a clash.
1258320	1268840	As you said earlier in your opening remarks, the Roman commentators change tone markedly once the Romans get into this country and decide they're going to make it part of the Roman Empire.
1269640	1271280	Can you talk about that, please?
1271280	1292200	Yes, I mean, there's an interesting episode, particularly in AD 60, which is rather a key year for Romano-British history, partly because of the rebellion of Boudicca, but also because it's the time when the Roman governor, Suetonius Paulinus, who was brought in by Nero particularly to, as a conquistador, as it were.
1293260	1297040	And Paulinus has decided that it's time to smash the Druids.
1297760	1300760	And the Druids have their Holy of Holies on the island of Anglesey.
1300760	1301420	Why is that?
1303000	1307160	Because Anglesey is on the edge of the known world.
1307380	1308440	Anglesey is an island.
1308780	1311840	Islands can be very sacred in antiquity.
1312420	1316820	And it was clearly, for some reason, considered there was a very holy grove there.
1317180	1321740	And that's where, when the Druids were sort of against the wall, as it were, they retreated.
1322240	1327000	Suetonius Paulinus took most of his legions and his auxiliaries all the way up to Anglesey.
1327040	1328100	How many people would that be?
1328100	1334480	Oh, we're talking about, I would say, about at least 20,000 people.
1334720	1338080	So he'd marched them up to Anglesey, 20,000 fully armed Roman soldiers.
1338100	1339380	Marched them up to Anglesey.
1339740	1342260	But the Druids weren't allowed to do military training.
1342420	1346440	So were they an unarmed bunch of people in Anglesey waiting to be slaughtered?
1346440	1349080	Well, it wasn't that they were not allowed.
1349620	1351740	They were exempt from military service.
1352320	1359720	But we also hear from Caesar, a rather pretty story, really, where if you wanted to be archdruid, you could actually fight your corner.
1359860	1362160	So they obviously weren't averse to the odd bit of sword play.
1362520	1363380	What do you mean, fight your corner?
1363480	1364180	Challenge the...
1364180	1364440	Challenge.
1364600	1368480	If you wanted to be archdruid, if you wanted to challenge the leadership, you might actually fight it out.
1368720	1369460	With a sword or whatever?
1369460	1371640	Yeah, which is a very pretty thought, in your long right robes.
1372380	1381160	But to go back to Anglesey, we know that our greatest source for this is Tacitus, who talks in quite some detail about the conquest of Anglesey.
1381780	1383840	And he talks about the Romans making flat-bottomed boats.
1383940	1387000	They get up the Medina Straits and land actually on Anglesey.
1387000	1400880	And they are met there by warriors and druids and sort of fanatical fury-like women, brandishing torches, and the druids are cursing.
1401100	1404160	And their weaponry is words.
1404480	1406080	We're going back again to the oral tradition.
1406600	1413320	Words, word power, satire, the ability of words and curses to turn something against the enemy.
1413320	1420740	Now, we have to remember that we always have this business that, you know, Gaul and Britain are very superstitious, rather barbaric and rather primitive and so on.
1421260	1423620	The Romans were unbelievably superstitious.
1424080	1432340	And the sight of these druids screaming imprecations at the soldiers trying to land would have been incredible psychological warfare.
1433560	1443300	So you have this picture of this sort of dense, armed mass of people and people armed with words and people armed with swords fighting to keep their groves safe.
1443320	1448560	And bottling up 20,000 Roman soldiers in the process.
1450080	1454900	But the Romans, from what I read, just slaughtered most of them.
1455680	1457380	They did, but they were interrupted.
1457780	1460800	It's not quite clear whether they actually managed the entire job.
1461440	1467940	Because while this is going on, Paulinus gets word that Boudicca is busy raising Roman towns to the ground.
1467940	1477480	Is there any connection, as I've read in the notes of somebody, one of you, that actually the druids wanted Boudicca to do that, to divert attention from Anglesey?
1477780	1480320	I think it was quite cleverly orchestrated.
1480860	1483840	I am quite sure that the druids were involved in this.
1484780	1490220	There is even a possibility, it's remote, that Boudicca herself might have been a druid.
1490320	1495880	Because we know that she was herself involved in divination, in sort of sacred groves in London.
1495880	1505680	And I think it was highly orchestrated, surely a coincidence, that Paulinus is up in the north-west and something happens in the south-east.
1506080	1507780	I didn't realise he'd taken so many troops.
1507840	1508620	That's a lot, isn't it?
1508740	1509360	It is a lot.
1509360	1520680	And one interesting thing, again, as Barry said, all this business about trying to get some archaeological evidence together with the written sources is so difficult.
1521040	1533700	But there's one theory I have, which I really like to posit here, and that is that on the way up to Anglesey, the Roman soldiers would have had to pass a place very close to Lindo Moss,
1533700	1542260	which is where Lindo Mann, a sacrificed young man, probably around that time, was found in 1984.
1542760	1549160	And I just wonder whether that was an aversion sacrifice to try and avert that disaster that was about to happen on Anglesey.
1549640	1555260	Justin Champion, why did the druids went into fairly steep decline, rather quickly?
1555820	1557260	Can you tell us why?
1557260	1564400	I mean, I'm pretty sure it's the result of Romanisation in both a military sense, but also in a legal sense,
1564520	1570900	because certainly at some point by the 60s AD, you can't be a Roman citizen and a druid,
1571000	1577440	so you're narrowing down the opportunities for learned men to go into the sort of business, if you like.
1577560	1581320	But after Mona, after the destruction at Anglesey...
1581320	1582220	Anglesey called Mona.
1582220	1589460	It's quite clear that Druidism is trying to be destroyed in all sorts of cultural ways,
1589500	1597280	and we don't really know that much into the early Anglo-Saxon period about what happens to them, I think.
1597280	1604340	But one can imagine, combined with Romanisation, the introduction of Christianity,
1604340	1613080	even if we believe some of the 17th century accounts, even this early, is a rival tradition.
1614720	1617900	I just wondered if we could perhaps add a little bit to that,
1618000	1621860	because there are later Roman writers who talk about Druids,
1622060	1627180	and that in itself is interesting because it means that the Druids remain in the Roman consciousness
1627180	1629020	right to the 4th century AD.
1629020	1632660	We have a poet called Osonius, a Bordeaux poet,
1633100	1638000	who wrote a very long treatise about his fellow rhetoricians at the University of Bordeaux,
1638260	1642860	and he talks about Druids, and by then he's talking of Druids being dynastic,
1643480	1647540	and the mantle of Druidism falling from father to son.
1647640	1650140	He actually mentions a number of people in this dynasty.
1650300	1654040	Now, whether or not these are the same kind of Druids that we would have found in Caesar,
1654320	1655240	I'm sure they weren't.
1655240	1660300	But the other interesting thing is a funny lot of documents called the Augustan Histories.
1660880	1663360	These date the sort of 3rd and 4th centuries AD,
1663960	1670200	and there are three or four stories about the accession to the purple of emperors like Aurelian,
1670360	1672220	Numerian and Diocletian,
1672840	1676540	and that is predicted by Gaulish Druidesses.
1677940	1680580	So what's interesting for me about that is that,
1680900	1682600	however much that may have been nonsense,
1682600	1685160	it means that Druids are still in the consciousness.
1686280	1687680	Barry Cunliffe,
1687960	1691160	although I've used the word exterminated,
1691380	1692280	as I've picked up properly,
1692720	1694720	that's not right, really.
1694820	1696020	They didn't disappear entirely,
1696220	1698600	and they're still continued in Ireland,
1699420	1700660	unconquered by the Romans.
1700780	1703760	Can you give us some idea how they drifted,
1703840	1704620	and this is ridiculous,
1704760	1708020	but for the next, well, say, 1,000 years,
1708120	1709980	after the 3rd, 4th century AD?
1709980	1712440	Yes, as you say,
1712500	1714060	they continued in Ireland for a while,
1714200	1719540	but were gradually turned into insignificance by the rise of Christianity.
1719920	1723480	But there were the Bards going on.
1723540	1724500	This Bardic tradition,
1724660	1725660	this oral tradition,
1725660	1729000	was an element of Druidism,
1729220	1732000	which continued into Irish society,
1732120	1734460	as indeed it did in Welsh society.
1734460	1737920	So if you're looking for any real thread of continuity,
1738240	1740440	the Bardic tradition in those two societies
1740440	1742620	is as good a thread as you can find,
1742760	1744460	but the religious overlay
1744460	1747620	has completely been wiped out by Christianity.
1748120	1750560	How reliable do you take the Bardic tradition?
1750760	1752800	Is it reinvented every 50 years,
1752880	1753860	every two or three generations?
1754060	1755380	Is there a real continuity?
1755880	1757400	There is a continuity.
1757940	1759240	Particularly in Wales,
1759580	1761380	it had almost died out.
1761380	1762220	At the Ice Stedfords,
1762640	1764840	you're getting about six or seven turning up.
1764880	1765060	When?
1765120	1765720	What day do we talk about?
1765720	1768920	We're talking about the 17th century.
1769320	1770060	The 19th century.
1770280	1770620	Oh, yes.
1770720	1772040	In the 18th century,
1772220	1773940	it begins to take off again
1773940	1775620	with the whole Celtic revival,
1775800	1777500	Celtomania.
1777780	1778120	But still,
1778220	1779420	we've missed out.
1780540	1782640	Have you got anything to get hold of
1782640	1785760	between about 400 AD and the 16th century?
1786240	1786960	Virtually nothing.
1786960	1788900	So what you're saying is
1788900	1790660	when it starts again in the 16th century,
1791260	1793860	they are making it up
1793860	1795860	as much as taking it for,
1796040	1797360	as much as inheriting it.
1797680	1798000	Yes.
1798060	1799300	From the 16th century onwards,
1799500	1802660	people are looking at the classical texts
1802660	1805060	and they are reinventing
1805060	1807220	a sort of romantic view of Druidism.
1807540	1809600	And you've only got these little threads
1809600	1811480	of things like the Ice Stedford,
1811600	1813860	like the storytellers,
1813860	1816420	which are a very pale reflection
1816420	1817320	of what went before.
1817960	1818600	Justin Champion,
1819400	1820660	John Aubrey in the 17th century
1820660	1822100	became interested in the Druids.
1822260	1823640	We know him from brief lives,
1824060	1825420	but he was an antiquarian
1825420	1827040	and some sort of archaeologist.
1827340	1828700	And the interest began,
1828820	1830000	which has never ceased really,
1830060	1831480	and he was one of the early,
1831700	1832660	let's call it modern,
1833160	1836420	persons to revive it.
1837160	1838180	Can you tell us about,
1838520	1839360	can you tell us what he did?
1840200	1841480	Aubrey in one sense
1841480	1844380	is a great under-explored scholar
1844380	1846060	and man of learning.
1846640	1848860	And he represents the sort of legacy
1848860	1849940	of Renaissance humanism.
1850020	1850900	As Barry's just said,
1851160	1853060	all of these classical texts,
1853160	1854560	whether it's Historia Augusta
1854560	1856100	or Pliny or Tacitus,
1856260	1858360	are rediscovered in the 16th century.
1859120	1861380	And nationalist scholars,
1861560	1862360	whether they're in France
1862360	1863740	or in England or in Ireland,
1864260	1865480	want to make a connection
1865480	1868540	with those sets of primary documents
1868540	1869420	and connect them
1869420	1870920	to their own particular communities.
1870920	1872520	So we'll get defences
1872520	1873620	of French Druidry,
1874000	1874880	English Druidry,
1875100	1876320	as texture things.
1876820	1878100	The step that Aubrey takes
1878100	1879700	is he goes out into the landscape,
1879860	1880960	to the ruins in the landscape.
1881220	1883760	He's perhaps the first field archaeologist.
1884340	1886080	And drawing from hints
1886080	1888380	from people like Inigo Jones,
1888500	1889860	who had studied Stonehenge
1889860	1891260	and was pretty much convinced
1891260	1893240	it was a Roman temple of some sort,
1893240	1896420	and reading sort of Danish scholarship
1896420	1898060	that say, no, no, Stonehenge
1898060	1900640	is a relic of a Danish conquest.
1901300	1903520	Aubrey goes out and measures,
1903740	1904620	draws, maps,
1904900	1906820	both Stonehenge and Avebury,
1907040	1908880	and then a whole series of other relics,
1909340	1912360	and makes the sort of intellectual leap
1912360	1915820	to connect those early sort of textual sources
1915820	1917580	with these real artefacts.
1917660	1919540	And I think from that moment on,
1919860	1920960	we can see the invention
1920960	1924240	of a whole series of Druidical practices.
1924740	1926820	And it's even more brilliant in one sense
1926820	1929240	that Aubrey is a great draftsman.
1929660	1932280	He commissions other representations.
1933040	1935000	And the drawings of Stonehenge
1935000	1937940	suddenly have little Druidical figures popping up
1937940	1941180	that he's lifted from another imaginative source.
1941660	1943900	And those representations persist.
1944340	1945160	I mean, they're reproduced
1945160	1946240	in many, many books today,
1946320	1949140	but they persist as ways of thinking imaginatively
1949140	1950480	about what Druids were.
1950960	1953420	Miranda, let's turn to Stonehenge
1953420	1955120	and William Stukeley
1955120	1957420	and the association that was there
1957420	1958160	for quite a while,
1958400	1960940	that Stonehenge was built by,
1961020	1964820	part of the Druids' tradition and religion.
1965600	1965760	Yes.
1965980	1967740	Can you tell this is about Stukeley?
1967880	1969700	Because Stukeley, as it were,
1969740	1970780	takes us on from Aubrey.
1971160	1971800	Stukeley does.
1971920	1972800	Stukeley's very interesting
1972800	1975260	because he's born in 1687.
1975260	1977680	He takes holy orders in 1729
1977680	1981520	and he becomes a clergyman
1981520	1984260	who then brings together his two great interests
1984260	1988100	in ancient religion and archaeology
1988100	1989740	and megaliths particularly.
1989740	1993160	And I think when we're thinking about Aubrey
1993160	1994620	and Stukeley and their fellows,
1995040	1998840	we have to remember that it's only comparatively recently
1998840	2001480	that we managed to get a long timeline
2001480	2003260	back into the remote past for Britain.
2003780	2007020	Before then, there was no means of, you know,
2007060	2008580	talking about a deep past,
2008820	2010180	a deep human past for Britain.
2010180	2012840	So Stukeley, like Aubrey,
2012960	2016500	saw Stonehenge as a pre-Roman temple.
2017140	2018660	The Druids were pre-Roman priests.
2019000	2022380	Therefore, Stonehenge must be associated with the Druids.
2022740	2024540	But Stukeley goes one step further.
2025000	2028000	He goes a bit strange after a while.
2028360	2030920	His sermons get more and more Druidic
2030920	2035960	and he finds an alleged inscription from Dijon
2035960	2038760	which talks about a Druid called Chindernax.
2038760	2042500	And Chindernax was a name that Stukeley adopted
2042500	2044460	and he began to sign his letters,
2045280	2048100	Your Sincerely Chindernax Druid.
2048880	2051080	So he didn't find any problem
2051080	2053980	with being clergymen and Church of England
2053980	2054820	at the same time.
2054960	2055740	No, no.
2055900	2057740	And I think that could have been partly,
2058060	2059220	if we can go back a little bit,
2059260	2059920	if you wouldn't mind,
2060380	2062580	to early Ireland and the interface
2062580	2063880	between paganism and Christianity.
2064500	2066420	We have wonderful documents
2066420	2068440	such as the 7th century lives of Bridget
2068440	2069140	and Patrick.
2069720	2071580	And Bridget is a particularly interesting one
2071580	2073840	because she grows up in a Druid's household
2073840	2075820	and he becomes Christianised
2075820	2076840	but remains a Druid.
2077160	2078860	And there doesn't seem to be a tension
2078860	2081180	between Christians and Druids.
2082000	2084180	I think your account of Stukeley is wonderful
2084180	2086280	and we need to sort of really emphasise
2086280	2088580	that he is doing Trinitarian archaeology.
2089060	2090560	Stukeley, in one sense,
2090640	2092040	subscribes to Usher's view
2092040	2094560	that the world is only about 6,000 years old.
2094560	2096480	So you've got to fit all of these things
2096480	2099300	from Adam to Moses to the Druids to now
2099300	2100780	into that chronology.
2101340	2103580	And he's reacting very, very much
2103580	2105760	against some of the deistical accounts
2105760	2107800	of the Druids as wicked pagan priests.
2108220	2111700	So Druidism is a form of patriarchal,
2111760	2112840	Abramic worship.
2113380	2115000	And it's not just Stukeley.
2115120	2116200	People like Isaac Newton,
2116580	2118420	supposed modern rationalists,
2118760	2121160	see Stonehenge as the remnants
2121160	2123140	of sort of ancient fire worship
2123140	2124940	that is only then contaminated
2124940	2126260	by corrupt Christianity.
2126840	2128100	Barrick, on Stonehenge,
2128220	2130560	it's been discredited that the Druids
2130560	2131900	could possibly have built Stonehenge.
2132000	2133440	It was built, hasn't it?
2133620	2133800	No.
2134140	2134940	Oh, I thought it was.
2134940	2135180	No, no.
2135320	2136460	Well, one of you told me that.
2136500	2137300	No, well, I think...
2137300	2138380	Who is a guilty contributor?
2138800	2140780	Yeah, there's some new ideas here
2140780	2141680	we've got to explore, I think.
2141960	2146360	The idea that Druids are to be related
2146360	2148240	with Latane culture, I think,
2148980	2152100	is an idea of the 50s and 60s
2152100	2152800	of the last century,
2152920	2154900	and most archaeologists have thrown that out.
2156100	2158100	If we try and find out...
2158100	2160280	If we look at the development
2160280	2161840	of religious structures
2161840	2164500	and behaviour in Britain
2164500	2167340	and look at what was happening
2167340	2168840	in the first century BC
2168840	2170000	when there were Druids
2170000	2172740	and then try and back-project
2172740	2174760	those behaviour patterns,
2174760	2176760	we can see that some elements
2176760	2179420	of the belief systems of the Druids,
2179800	2181320	cosmology, for example,
2181400	2182620	can be dated right back
2182620	2185040	to at least 3000 BC in Britain.
2185720	2187020	Some of the practices
2187020	2188740	of digging deep shafts
2188740	2190800	and putting offerings in them,
2190860	2191880	again, can go back
2191880	2193720	to the 3rd or 2nd millennium.
2194180	2196140	So I think there is a good case
2196140	2197000	to be made out
2197000	2199400	for the belief systems
2199400	2201300	of the Druids
2201300	2204420	from the 4th or 3rd centuries BC
2204420	2205940	are deeply rooted
2205940	2207280	in the belief systems
2207280	2208200	of the area
2208200	2209320	that go right back
2209320	2210440	into the Neolithic period.
2210740	2211420	But Stonehenge
2211420	2212280	is so emblematic.
2212780	2213520	Can you just...
2213520	2214280	You said...
2214280	2215160	Yes, they might...
2215160	2216060	Look, I'm...
2216060	2218140	There's a revolution
2218140	2218840	going on in my head.
2218900	2220360	I came here all prepared to put...
2220360	2220620	All right.
2220740	2221700	You say that they could have
2221700	2222700	had a hand in building it.
2222960	2223720	Or they could have built it.
2223720	2224220	Could be that.
2224380	2225200	No, no, not quite.
2225300	2225820	You're putting words
2225820	2226420	in my mouth here.
2227180	2228060	No, what I'm saying
2228060	2231500	is that the religious beliefs
2231500	2234800	which later are practiced
2234800	2235740	by the Druids
2235740	2238080	might be very deep-rooted
2238080	2238560	in Britain
2238560	2239760	and might be reflected
2239760	2241620	in buildings like Stonehenge.
2241620	2243580	Now, whether they were
2243580	2245140	calling themselves Druids
2245140	2246700	at that time,
2246900	2247720	who knows?
2248260	2249880	But we've got to look
2249880	2250460	for the roots
2250460	2251940	of these belief systems
2251940	2253300	and the roots go back in time.
2253580	2254840	Would it be fair to say, then,
2254840	2259080	that the Druids adopted Stonehenge
2259080	2260960	and for...
2260960	2261800	You're shaking your head again.
2262220	2262440	No.
2263400	2264120	Strangely enough,
2264180	2265560	there's no real evidence,
2266020	2267360	very little evidence...
2267360	2268080	Well, when did the...
2268080	2270040	We now think of Stonehenge
2270040	2270920	and the Druids together.
2271120	2271240	OK.
2271320	2272000	Well, let's get to...
2272000	2273360	Let me get to the hinge of it.
2273480	2273600	OK.
2273640	2274440	When did that happen?
2275860	2276340	Right.
2278340	2279760	People like Aubrey,
2280280	2281740	people like Stukley
2281740	2284180	came up with the idea
2284180	2285940	that Stonehenge
2285940	2286500	and Avebury
2286500	2287540	were the temples
2287540	2288280	of the Druids.
2288780	2289880	And that idea
2289880	2291320	has pervaded
2291320	2294020	scholarly and less scholarly
2294020	2295760	thought since then.
2296160	2297960	Now, what I'm saying...
2297960	2299140	Archaeologists have come in
2299140	2299540	and said,
2299760	2300440	absolute rubbish,
2300620	2301200	there are only Druids
2301200	2302240	from the 4th century BC.
2302660	2303560	Stonehenge is a lot earlier
2303560	2303920	than that,
2303980	2304580	so it can't be.
2304960	2306160	What I'm saying
2306160	2306840	with a number
2306840	2307580	of other archaeologists
2307580	2308840	is that the roots
2308840	2309660	go back deeper
2309660	2311980	and it's not impossible
2311980	2313660	that rituals
2313660	2314660	similar to those
2314660	2315920	of the Druidic rituals
2315920	2317000	were associated
2317000	2318660	with the building
2318660	2320040	and the early use
2320040	2320660	of Stonehenge.
2321260	2322320	I think, Barry,
2322360	2322860	that's why
2322860	2324400	the other figure
2324400	2325460	we could talk about,
2325520	2326200	John Toland,
2326420	2327760	is so interesting
2327760	2328780	because although
2328780	2330820	his critical history
2330820	2331540	of the Druids
2331540	2332260	and a specimen
2332260	2333200	of Celtic learning
2333200	2334200	is probably,
2334800	2336180	at the end of the day,
2336300	2337000	nothing more
2337000	2337500	than a very,
2337600	2338720	very elaborate joke
2338720	2339980	but a very
2339980	2341720	extraordinarily learned one,
2342640	2343920	he represents
2343920	2345800	some sort of early
2345800	2347260	pre-Egyptian,
2347500	2349340	pre-Pythagorean Druidism
2349340	2350640	taking place
2350640	2351740	not just in Ireland,
2351900	2352700	not just in Wales,
2352800	2353760	but certainly in Scotland
2353760	2355320	and he confects
2355320	2357020	this entire sort of
2357020	2358800	early Druid republic
2358800	2359440	where everything
2359440	2360180	is godly
2360180	2361620	and virtuous.
2362860	2363440	We've missed
2363440	2364280	our human sacrifice
2364280	2364900	and we haven't got
2364900	2365300	much time.
2365380	2366140	We've got to turn to it
2366140	2366740	because it's part
2366740	2367300	of the story.
2367500	2369040	They were accused of,
2369080	2369260	well,
2369440	2369960	there's been human
2369960	2370900	sacrifice in so many
2370900	2371700	religions and they
2371700	2372140	continue.
2373700	2374180	Can you,
2374380	2375660	and it was thought
2375660	2376860	by some early writers
2376860	2377960	and some early commentators,
2378040	2379040	was this black propaganda
2379040	2379560	that Miranda
2379560	2380280	you're going to tell us,
2380600	2381880	as being excessive,
2382120	2383540	that altars ran with blood,
2383740	2384620	that sort of thing.
2384860	2386000	What about human sacrifice
2386000	2386620	and the Druids?
2386660	2387180	What do we know?
2388540	2389780	I think it's fair to say
2389780	2390700	that human sacrifice
2390700	2391960	probably did take place.
2392100	2392480	There is some
2392480	2393200	archaeological evidence
2393200	2393780	for it,
2393920	2394320	for example,
2394380	2395060	in the bog bodies
2395060	2396420	places like Lindo Moss
2396420	2397300	that I've mentioned before
2397300	2398340	and quite a lot
2398340	2399240	of other evidence
2399240	2400700	but the archaeological
2400700	2401940	evidence suggests
2401940	2403060	that it was happening
2403060	2404060	but it was rare
2404060	2405340	and it would only happen
2405340	2406440	at times of great crisis
2406440	2407860	and I think what's happened
2407860	2409620	is that when Caesar
2409620	2410340	talks about it,
2410400	2411060	he talks about it
2411060	2412220	in a very matter-of-fact way.
2412860	2415240	He says it is,
2415600	2416300	the Druids find it
2416300	2418060	appropriate to sacrifice
2418780	2419700	human beings
2419700	2422120	for efficacious purposes.
2422680	2423460	They would try and use
2423460	2424140	prisoners of war
2424140	2424600	or criminals
2424600	2425280	but if there weren't
2425280	2425580	enough
2425580	2426520	then the innocents
2426520	2427320	would make up
2427320	2427740	the numbers.
2428480	2429060	He's very pragmatic
2429060	2429640	about this.
2429860	2430540	We have to remember
2430540	2431860	that human sacrifice
2431860	2433440	was only outlawed
2433440	2434700	in Rome in 97 BC,
2434880	2435860	not that long ago
2435860	2436960	before Caesar.
2437660	2438620	The other writers
2438620	2439240	like Pliny,
2439400	2439920	like Tacitus,
2440060	2440580	like Lucan,
2440820	2441660	they do sort of
2441660	2443580	talk it up a bit.
2443700	2444460	They do talk about
2444460	2445460	altars running with blood
2445460	2447360	but I think human sacrifice
2447360	2448300	did take place
2448300	2449080	but it was not
2449080	2450660	that out of the ordinary.
2450820	2451240	It was not
2451240	2452980	that big a deal.
2452980	2453580	Barry?
2453940	2454340	Barry Conner?
2454520	2454760	Yes,
2454900	2456140	there is evidence
2456140	2458400	in Iron Age archaeology
2458400	2460440	that bodies,
2460700	2462200	people were sacrificed
2462200	2462640	I think.
2463200	2464720	I excavated some pits
2464720	2465540	in a hill fort
2465540	2466180	called Dainbury
2466180	2468560	where there are bodies
2468560	2470380	thrown into the bottoms
2470380	2470960	of pits
2470960	2471940	with stones
2471940	2472980	heaped down on them.
2473080	2474080	Now that doesn't look
2474080	2475040	very much like
2475040	2476260	normal burial practice
2476260	2478240	so there are hints
2478240	2478760	like that
2478760	2479840	in the archaeological evidence
2479840	2480840	and indeed
2480840	2481560	the bog bodies
2481560	2482660	but I think Miranda
2482660	2483740	is absolutely right
2483740	2485620	that this was an extreme.
2486200	2487220	This was what you did
2487220	2488440	when things were going
2488440	2489760	really got bad
2489760	2491300	and you had to placate
2491300	2491780	the gods
2491780	2493280	rather like the Carthaginians
2493280	2494860	sacrificing their kids
2494860	2496000	when things went bad.
2496800	2497720	I think one of the
2497720	2498460	interesting things
2498460	2499360	is that the 18th
2499360	2500120	and 19th century
2500120	2501420	aren't really interested
2501420	2502760	in Druids as sacrifices.
2502980	2503500	They're interested
2503500	2505320	in Druids as recoverers
2505320	2505940	of some sort of
2505940	2506760	natural spirit
2506760	2508580	and the huge sort of effort
2508580	2509900	into reconstructing
2509900	2510640	Druidical temples
2510640	2511380	and saving land
2511380	2512300	Exactly
2512300	2513500	so they're communing
2513500	2514080	with nature
2514080	2515200	they're the sort of
2515200	2516280	early ecological
2516280	2517020	sort of warriors
2517020	2517600	in one sense.
2517620	2518620	Yes they are very much so
2518620	2519800	and these holy sites
2519800	2520920	become preserved sites
2520920	2522340	and the idea of preserving sites
2522340	2523540	owes a lot to that.
2523800	2525300	And even to the lengths
2525300	2526700	of very wealthy aristocrats
2526700	2528960	importing from Brittany
2528960	2529540	and elsewhere
2529540	2530540	sacred sites
2530540	2531560	and reconstructing them
2531560	2532940	in their own sort of land.
2533300	2534060	Well thank you very much

2536660	2537900	next year we'll be talking
2537900	2539900	about the ontological argument
2539900	2540680	first outlined
2540680	2541620	in the 7th century
2541620	2542760	by Anselm
2542760	2543760	the argument
2543760	2544380	is an attempt
2544380	2545300	to prove the existence
2545300	2545820	of God
2545820	2546840	through reason alone.
2547000	2547580	Thanks for listening.

2569200	2570960	I'm in my 40s now
2570960	2572520	the door is almost closed
2572520	2574060	and suddenly
2574060	2575420	I'm not so sure
2575420	2577060	the story has
2577060	2578280	always been no
2578280	2579880	I'm just wondering
2579880	2581080	to what degree
2581080	2582300	it's just a story.
2583080	2584100	Definitely just a story.
