2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,660
For years, I've sounded like a broken record.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,400
I do not want kids.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,820
I do not ever want to have kids.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,120
I don't want to have a kid, don't want to have a kid, don't want to have a kid.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,460
I'm in my 40s now. The door is almost closed.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,340
And suddenly, I'm not so sure.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,200
The story has always been no.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm just wondering to what degree it's just a story.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,020
Definitely just a story.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,920
From CBC's Personally, this is Creation Myth.

Available now wherever you get your podcasts.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,960
And their victims were the Druids, an ancient religious order which was ruthlessly eliminated from Roman Britain.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,620
The Druids were active in Britain, Ireland and Gaul and flourished for many centuries.

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,260
They were reasonably well chronicled by ancient authors including Julius Caesar and Posidonius.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,940
Much later, thanks to a revival of interest in the 17th century, they inspired a wealth of literature and art.

17
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:30,640
But because the Druids were an oral culture and left no written records of their own, comparatively little is known about their beliefs and practices.

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,040
And the reinventions of the Druidical traditions by Romantic writers have resulted in much misconception and myth.

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,760
With me to discuss the ancient Druids are Justin Champion, Professor of the History of Early Modern Ideas at Royal Holloway, University of London.

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,740
Barry Cunliffe, Emeritus Professor of European Archaeology at the University of Oxford.

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,480
And Miranda Oldhouse-Green, Professor of Archaeology at Cardiff University.

22
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,640
Justin Champion, who were the Druids and where did they live?

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,540
The Druids really, I think, flourished between the late 4th century BC and the end of the 2nd century AD.

24
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,760
They're predominantly map onto the late Iron Age culture called Latin.

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,360
They're very eminent in England, in Britain, in Wales and in Brittany, in Gaul.

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,520
So they cover that period.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,480
The problem we have is that the sources, the literary sources that expose their traditions are very, very fragmentary.

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,420
They're palimpsests, written over earlier traditions.

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,980
We know Druids existed in this culture because we can look at place names.

30
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,240
We can look at the spread of Celtic language.

31
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,860
But actually identifying the key areas is quite difficult.

32
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,480
One of the problems we have is that they were a determinedly oral culture.

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,860
Can you tell us why they were and what the consequence of that is?

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,820
Well, one of the problems is that they are a priesthood of some sort.

35
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,440
And they believe that they understand deep secret knowledge and that they pass it on to people of their own ilk.

36
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:09,740
That means that they don't leave artifacts and texts for us to study as modern historians and archaeologists.

37
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:22,140
And one of the problems is, is trying to coordinate the reportage of Druids in figures like Caesar and Pliny later with some of the archaeological temples and buildings that we know.

38
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:29,880
And certainly later on in the period, the 17th and 18th century, there's huge amounts of speculation about connecting that oral culture.

39
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:38,540
Of course, there are traditions in the early medieval periods that somehow draw from an oral tradition, particularly in Ireland.

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,240
And those, again, are exploited by 17th and 18th century figures.

41
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,800
But it's a very, very mysterious business.

42
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,400
Can we just go back for a moment or two, just not go back, go to this oral tradition idea?

43
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:58,860
Because many, many civilizations are remote from us because of their insistence on an oral tradition, which is fascinating.

44
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,660
You said they were priesthood.

45
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,040
They wanted to keep it among themselves.

46
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,540
But in a way, I think it I've read anyway, it's more extensive and deeper than that.

47
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,260
Can you just dwell on that for a moment or two?

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:19,680
I think one of the things that we we have difficulty with is, of course, Christianity became so dominant, even in the early centuries after Christ.

49
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:28,460
And that one of the projects that the Roman Empire alongside Christianity has was to actually obscure many, many aspects of that oral culture.

50
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,880
It has to be sort of destroyed.

51
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,140
It hasn't got to the point of why they insisted on it.

52
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:40,780
I've read it's because they thought that the writing was lazy, that they thought that writing was open to misinterpretations, which oral culture wasn't.

53
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,520
And are these any explanations?

54
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,740
Those are good, plausible explanations.

55
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:54,780
And certainly the Druids, because they read nature, they read sort of deeper philosophy, want to be able to communicate effectively with their local communities.

56
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,900
And, of course, writing is open to rhetoric and to exploitation.

57
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:10,780
There is one tradition, though, that says Druid thinking is captured in this mysterious language called Ogham, little marks on wooden sticks and on stones.

58
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,280
But, of course, we don't actually know very much about Ogham script itself.

59
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,220
And the invention of an oral tradition captured in that form is very much a 17th century tradition.

60
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,560
Barry Cunliffe, can you tell us then about the earliest chronicled references to the Druids?

61
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,920
Well, as Justin said, we've got lots of snippets of information about the Druids spread across a number of classical writers.

62
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:44,220
But from about the 1st century BC to about the 7th century AD, most of those classical writers are quoting secondhand, thirdhand, fourthhand from other classical writers.

63
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:54,580
So the game, really, is to try and sort out when the first and when the inputs of new information about the Druids sort of hit the literary world.

64
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:10,960
I think one could argue that the first input of real information comes around 300 BC with the journeys of a very remarkable man called Pythias who lived in Marseille.

65
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,020
He was a Greek. And he made a journey. We know about this journey.

66
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,540
He made a journey. I think he was trying to work out where the tin came from.

67
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,360
Tin was very important for the Greek economy. And it was coming from the northwest.

68
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:38,780
So he traveled through France, got into the Atlantic, probably took local boats, went to Brittany, crossed to Cornwall, up the Irish Sea, to the Northern Isles, down the east coast of Britain, down the Channel, and back to Brittany.

69
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,800
Back to Marseille, where he wrote a book called On the Ocean.

70
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:52,880
Now, that was the main source of information about the northwest of Europe, the Atlantic shores of Europe.

71
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
And that book, On the Ocean, we don't have.

72
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,560
But lots of other people started to use it as a source.

73
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,780
People like Timaeus, who was a Sicilian historian.

74
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:10,580
And people like Eratosthenes, a very interesting man around 200 BC, he was the librarian, chief librarian at Alexandria.

75
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,860
And people like that were using this early source.

76
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,560
And what were they finding about Druids in his account?

77
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,660
They were finding a lot about Britain.

78
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,880
And they were picking up little snippets of information about Druids.

79
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,280
And particularly, the theme that comes over is Druids as philosophers, as natural philosophers.

80
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,900
This is the early, let's call this the early Greek tradition, the Greek or Alexandrian tradition.

81
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,580
And that really does focus, not on all the ritual and blood and things like that.

82
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,300
It focuses on the intellectual quality of the Druid.

83
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,140
And the Greeks were very impressed.

84
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,700
They compared Druids rather to Pythagoras.

85
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:55,020
And Druids had these strange ideas that the soul was immortal, and so on.

86
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,080
Did Posidonius later, was it two centuries later, did he take up, did he build on Pythagoras' ideas?

87
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,760
He was an anthropologist, or did he do some original work of his own?

88
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,020
No, Posidonius was the next sort of input of new information.

89
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,080
Posidonius was a Stoic philosopher from Apamea in Syria.

90
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,740
He was Greek.

91
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:20,260
But he spent most of his time on the island of Rhodes, in the sort of university atmosphere of Rhodes.

92
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,000
But he was writing a history of the ancient world.

93
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,080
And like a good historian, he actually did his fieldwork.

94
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,180
And one of the bits of fieldwork he did was to go to southern France, Gaul,

95
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,500
when just a generation after the Romans had just taken over that southern strip of France,

96
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,760
ostensibly to work out how Hannibal got through the Alps and so on.

97
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,700
He was writing about that.

98
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,840
And he came across Celts and observed the habits of the Celts and the Druids and so on.

99
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,760
And he put a lot of new information into the pot.

100
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,580
What are the likely origins, the deep origins?

101
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,380
You've mentioned Pythagoras, the claims that it goes back to Moses, 13th century BC,

102
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,580
that it even goes back to Egypt, the Druid tradition.

103
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,240
Now, what are we to make of that?

104
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,440
What do you see as the origins?

105
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,100
Well, I think I can just take the evidence.

106
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:16,840
And what we've got to live with is a remark by Julius Caesar that the Druids originated in Britain.

107
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
And if you want to study the Druids, you've got to go to Britain to do so.

108
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,000
Now, we don't have to believe everything Caesar says.

109
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,980
Why did this business of Egypt, Moses and Pythagoras come in then?

110
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,080
Well, it was the later Greek writers who were looking back...

111
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,380
Was it Strabo and people like that?

112
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:40,100
No, people like Clement of Alexandria and some of the later Christians looking back on this

113
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:48,240
and saying that really the beliefs of the Druids were so much like Pythagoras

114
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,060
that either Pythagoras got them from the Druids or the other way around.

115
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,480
Belief being the transmigration of the cell, for instance.

116
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,800
That's right, that sort of thing.

117
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,340
But where the origin of the Druid belief came from, as Justin said,

118
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,220
it's concentrated in Britain, Ireland and France.

119
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,940
And that's where most of the place names, most of the evidence is.

120
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:18,240
And I think if you look, take Caesar's view that they might have originated in Britain.

121
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,300
Caesar, can I go across to Miranda for Caesar, Barry?

122
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,820
Do you mind?

123
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,100
Miranda, so we've got Caesar who gives us a very, quite a detailed account,

124
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,200
chronicle of the Druids.

125
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,220
Can you just tell listeners what he says about them?

126
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:32,920
Yes.

127
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,160
We take it he's a reasonably reliable historian.

128
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,100
He was on the case.

129
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
He was in Gaul for eight years.

130
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,880
He knew about this country as well.

131
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,640
Yes, he was in Gaul for about sort of eight or nine years in the 50s BC.

132
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,120
He was a Roman general and he wrote a war commentary called the Gallic Wars or De Bello Gallico.

133
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:57,100
And he, most of the books, there are seven books written by him in his lifetime and then one posthumous one.

134
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,280
But in book six, he digresses from his normal war diaries where he's talking about, you know,

135
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,340
conquering different tribes and polities in Gaul.

136
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:11,200
And he digresses to talk about customs and practices of Gauls and Germans and Britons to an extent.

137
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,180
And there's a quite a long piece in book six about the society in Gaul at the time he was writing.

138
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,260
And he says very tellingly that there were only two lots of people of any account, the Knights and the Druids.

139
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,420
And he's obviously far more interested in the Druids than anybody else.

140
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:34,160
He says they're in charge of all religious practices, that they are judges, they are teachers, they are natural scientists, they study the cosmos.

141
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,580
And they were immensely influential in all political and religious matters.

142
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,980
And Caesar is quite clearly quite impressed with them.

143
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:50,620
We learned later on, or not actually, but earlier on in the commentaries, that he had a very good friend called Diviciarchus,

144
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,720
who was the leader of a Burgundian tribe called the Aedui.

145
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,620
It's a Romanised name of a Celt.

146
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,360
Of a Celtic tribe, Diviciarchus, yes, indeed.

147
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,100
And he was a leader, but he was also in charge of religion.

148
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:16,180
And Cicero picks up Diviciarchus, who visited Rome in 60 BC, and Cicero meets him and talks about what an impressive person he is

149
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,740
and how good he is at divining the future, how good he is at augury, and he was a Druid.

150
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,400
So Caesar has this powerful ally, Diviciarchus, whom Cicero picks up on.

151
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:36,380
And the general impression you get from Caesar is that they are impressive intellectuals, they are worthy of Caesar's interest.

152
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,580
He also picks up on this business about oral tradition, Caesar, and he says quite clearly there are two reasons for lack of writing.

153
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,800
One is secrecy and the need to keep knowledge to the few.

154
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,620
And the second is to train memory.

155
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,800
And I think the whole idea about the Druids is that they are keepers of ancestral tradition.

156
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,280
They are, in a sense, the keepers of the culture of the communities in which they operated.

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,480
Is there any corroboration?

158
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:11,540
I mean, the interesting thing about Caesar's chronicle, apart from its interest, from what he says, is that it is detailed.

159
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,020
He claims an awful lot.

160
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,440
He makes a very grand claim for the Druids.

161
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,200
Is there any corroboration?

162
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,980
Is he alone?

163
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
What reasons do you have for believing him?

164
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:29,680
I think partly because he was surrounded by fellow Romans of similar status to himself.

165
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:37,820
He was writing his commentaries specifically to justify what were slightly dodgy actions in Gaul.

166
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,880
He didn't really have a mandate from the Senate for what he was doing in Gaul.

167
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,720
And I think part of the commentaries, part of the purpose of the commentaries was to legitimize what he was doing.

168
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,020
But he had people with him like Cicero's brother Quintus.

169
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:55,940
And I think had he sort of made it all up, I think people might have actually rumbled him and said something.

170
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:03,360
So although some of it may be sort of flannel and embroidery, I think he's one of our best sources.

171
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,380
Because the great thing about Caesar is he's writing at the time when the Druids were particularly prevalent.

172
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:18,120
What evidence did he put forward, if he put forward any evidence, that this had begun, the origin of the thing in north-west Europe was in Britain?

173
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,660
He actually says it is thought that Druidry began in Britain and was exported to Gaul.

174
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,160
And that's actually quite interesting because later on Pliny, who's another source of the Druids...

175
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,260
Pliny the Elder.

176
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,180
Pliny the Elder actually says exactly the opposite.

177
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,260
So who knows?

178
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,600
After Caesar, are there any classical authors who are as detailed and as convincing?

179
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,640
Not as detailed, but Pliny is quite...

180
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,400
He's quite interesting.

181
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:52,040
The later writers in the 1st century AD, there's a subtle change in how Druids are regarded by Romans.

182
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,360
So Caesar is fairly complementary about them.

183
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,560
People like Pliny, Tacitus and Lucan in the 1st century AD are fairly anti them.

184
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,640
And what you're getting now is the barbarian, the savage, human sacrifices talked up.

185
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,300
Is it propaganda or do you think it's a more realistic, more truthful analysis?

186
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,280
Well, a bit of both, I think.

187
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
Because the Romans didn't...

188
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,900
We're coming to that, but the Romans found the Druids an obstacle when they came to this country.

189
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,740
I think, yes, I think the Romans found the Druids a bit of a pain, partly because they were very highly nationalistic

190
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,760
and were clearly focuses of sedition and rebellion.

191
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,600
So when you are annexing a province, the last thing you want is Druids in people's ears going,

192
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,560
no, we don't want that.

193
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,120
And, of course, it's in the Druids' best interests for Rome not to succeed

194
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,320
because the whole of their power base would go.

195
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,760
Druids' power depends upon Gallic society and British society being hierarchical, highly stratified.

196
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,620
Once you bring Romans into the mix, the whole of society falls apart and is reinvented.

197
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,100
And there is no place for Druids in that.

198
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,200
So we're talking about the beginnings of a sort of propaganda.

199
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,660
And before we move on, when you say Davidiacus, Davidiacus met Cicero in Rome,

200
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,020
which language did they speak in?

201
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,160
Ah, Latin.

202
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:03,840
Right.

203
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,540
So the Druids knew Latin.

204
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,160
OK.

205
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,540
Well, enough.

206
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,080
If you can talk to Cicero, you're not doing badly.

207
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,800
No, indeed not.

208
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,740
OK.

209
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,940
Justin, Justin Champion, let's develop the idea of the Druids in society in Britain.

210
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,840
And we know quite a bit now.

211
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,600
So you just developed that.

212
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,640
How powerful were they?

213
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,580
The word power has been mentioned by Miranda.

214
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,240
I think, once again, we've got to be very cautious because we're drawing from these little fragments of sources

215
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,620
and sort of stitching them together.

216
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,440
You know, if we believe Caesar, the Druids are very highly organised.

217
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,860
You know, they have annual meetings.

218
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,120
They're arch-Druids.

219
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,160
They elect, they sort of confer and communicate across Gaul and Britain.

220
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:51,960
Within those societies, though, as Miranda said, that they are judges, they're teachers, they're motivators in some sense.

221
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,220
And I think that's one of the reasons why the Romans have difficulties with them.

222
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,500
The doctrine of the transmigration of the souls, I think it's Caesar says, makes men very brave.

223
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:07,040
Because if you know you may come back, then you're not going to be afraid to die in a war defending your own sort of community.

224
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,200
So I think we can think of the Druids as experts.

225
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,220
You know, they're not quite priests.

226
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,440
They're more than priests.

227
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:25,320
Certainly, as Pliny and the later sources expound and embroider on, they're involved with medical practice.

228
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,660
They're judges.

229
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,760
They're people who will negotiate between strife within communities.

230
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,260
So they're very powerful figures.

231
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,420
Caesar describes two sorts, knights and Druids.

232
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:45,800
Certainly, I think, after the Christian era, Druids are more and more marginalised and are starting to be thought of as sort of slightly odd magicians.

233
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,740
You know, they retreat, perhaps, out of communities.

234
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,600
So they're very powerful figures that we don't quite have a modern equivalent for, I think.

235
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,660
What do we know about the Druids' beliefs and rituals, then, Barry Cunner?

236
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,340
Well, strangely, very little.

237
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,660
We can pick up bits of it.

238
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,980
The Druid has...

239
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:17,500
If you're communicating as an ordinary person with the gods, you can only do so through the Druid.

240
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,320
So the Druid is an intermediary to start with.

241
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,040
So I want you to...

242
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,380
That's one point I was hesitating, stumbling off.

243
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,180
We're just in there.

244
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,360
But let's take it with you.

245
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:32,020
Was it a prime source of their power that they were, your word, the intermediaries between the gods and the...

246
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,820
They could do it.

247
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,000
They could take you to God.

248
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,900
They could tell you what God wanted to do and what God was going to do.

249
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,160
And that was the real keystone of their power.

250
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,960
Absolutely right.

251
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:50,480
As it is of most priesthoods, the priesthoods maintain their power because you, as an ordinary person, can't communicate with the gods without their presence.

252
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,960
And Caesar actually is quite specific about this.

253
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,860
He says that they can prevent you from communicating with the gods.

254
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,380
In other words, excommunicate you.

255
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,640
And no one will speak to you and you'll just fall apart and have to go away.

256
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,920
So they have immense power because they are the only way that you can contact the gods.

257
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,480
So you say we don't know much about their beliefs, but Christians began to claim that they, in some ways, prefigured Christianity.

258
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,680
Was that much later?

259
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,860
Yes, that comes later when people are trying to bring these two things together.

260
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,400
But we see them as the intermediaries.

261
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,720
There is one famous bit of ritual.

262
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:40,200
In fact, it's the only decent bit of ritual we've got, which Pliny talks about, which is the famous cutting of the mistletoe with a golden sickle.

263
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:48,120
And he explains this in quite a lot of detail, how you have to have the right time of the moon.

264
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,700
The moon mustn't be too strong.

265
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,780
It mustn't be too weak.

266
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,040
So you choose your time.

267
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:02,100
And that's one of the other aspects of the Druids' control, that they controlled our knowledge of time, when is an appropriate time to do things, when isn't an appropriate time to do things.

268
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,440
Very powerful, that is.

269
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,620
And then you had to dress in, the priest had to dress in white robes.

270
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,080
The mistletoe growing on the oak was particularly powerful.

271
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,940
And you cut it with a golden sickle.

272
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,300
It fell on a white cloth.

273
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,740
You sacrificed white oxen and so on.

274
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,360
So you get a sense of the complexity of belief and ritual there.

275
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,940
Why mistletoe?

276
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,880
I don't know what the particular power of mistletoe is, but the power of their belief in it was obviously very strong.

277
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,520
They said it was all curing.

278
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:43,860
But they also, and the same bit of Pliny, shows how very important their knowledge of plant law was and healing and the science of plants.

279
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,560
So we just get that little glimpse from Pliny.

280
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,380
Miranda, I'll just screen.

281
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,880
What was the, let's talk about the Druids now and the occupying Roman power.

282
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,900
In come the Romans.

283
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,920
There are the Druids.

284
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,460
There's a clash.

285
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:08,840
As you said earlier in your opening remarks, the Roman commentators change tone markedly once the Romans get into this country and decide they're going to make it part of the Roman Empire.

286
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,280
Can you talk about that, please?

287
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:32,200
Yes, I mean, there's an interesting episode, particularly in AD 60, which is rather a key year for Romano-British history, partly because of the rebellion of Boudicca, but also because it's the time when the Roman governor, Suetonius Paulinus, who was brought in by Nero particularly to, as a conquistador, as it were.

288
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,040
And Paulinus has decided that it's time to smash the Druids.

289
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,760
And the Druids have their Holy of Holies on the island of Anglesey.

290
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,420
Why is that?

291
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,160
Because Anglesey is on the edge of the known world.

292
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,440
Anglesey is an island.

293
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,840
Islands can be very sacred in antiquity.

294
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,820
And it was clearly, for some reason, considered there was a very holy grove there.

295
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,740
And that's where, when the Druids were sort of against the wall, as it were, they retreated.

296
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,000
Suetonius Paulinus took most of his legions and his auxiliaries all the way up to Anglesey.

297
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,100
How many people would that be?

298
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:14,480
Oh, we're talking about, I would say, about at least 20,000 people.

299
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,080
So he'd marched them up to Anglesey, 20,000 fully armed Roman soldiers.

300
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,380
Marched them up to Anglesey.

301
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,260
But the Druids weren't allowed to do military training.

302
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,440
So were they an unarmed bunch of people in Anglesey waiting to be slaughtered?

303
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,080
Well, it wasn't that they were not allowed.

304
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,740
They were exempt from military service.

305
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:39,720
But we also hear from Caesar, a rather pretty story, really, where if you wanted to be archdruid, you could actually fight your corner.

306
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,160
So they obviously weren't averse to the odd bit of sword play.

307
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,380
What do you mean, fight your corner?

308
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,180
Challenge the...

309
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,440
Challenge.

310
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,480
If you wanted to be archdruid, if you wanted to challenge the leadership, you might actually fight it out.

311
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,460
With a sword or whatever?

312
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,640
Yeah, which is a very pretty thought, in your long right robes.

313
00:22:52,380 --> 00:23:01,160
But to go back to Anglesey, we know that our greatest source for this is Tacitus, who talks in quite some detail about the conquest of Anglesey.

314
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,840
And he talks about the Romans making flat-bottomed boats.

315
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,000
They get up the Medina Straits and land actually on Anglesey.

316
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:20,880
And they are met there by warriors and druids and sort of fanatical fury-like women, brandishing torches, and the druids are cursing.

317
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,160
And their weaponry is words.

318
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,080
We're going back again to the oral tradition.

319
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:33,320
Words, word power, satire, the ability of words and curses to turn something against the enemy.

320
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:40,740
Now, we have to remember that we always have this business that, you know, Gaul and Britain are very superstitious, rather barbaric and rather primitive and so on.

321
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,620
The Romans were unbelievably superstitious.

322
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:52,340
And the sight of these druids screaming imprecations at the soldiers trying to land would have been incredible psychological warfare.

323
00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:03,300
So you have this picture of this sort of dense, armed mass of people and people armed with words and people armed with swords fighting to keep their groves safe.

324
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,560
And bottling up 20,000 Roman soldiers in the process.

325
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,900
But the Romans, from what I read, just slaughtered most of them.

326
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,380
They did, but they were interrupted.

327
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,800
It's not quite clear whether they actually managed the entire job.

328
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,940
Because while this is going on, Paulinus gets word that Boudicca is busy raising Roman towns to the ground.

329
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:37,480
Is there any connection, as I've read in the notes of somebody, one of you, that actually the druids wanted Boudicca to do that, to divert attention from Anglesey?

330
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,320
I think it was quite cleverly orchestrated.

331
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,840
I am quite sure that the druids were involved in this.

332
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,220
There is even a possibility, it's remote, that Boudicca herself might have been a druid.

333
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,880
Because we know that she was herself involved in divination, in sort of sacred groves in London.

334
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:05,680
And I think it was highly orchestrated, surely a coincidence, that Paulinus is up in the north-west and something happens in the south-east.

335
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,780
I didn't realise he'd taken so many troops.

336
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,620
That's a lot, isn't it?

337
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,360
It is a lot.

338
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:20,680
And one interesting thing, again, as Barry said, all this business about trying to get some archaeological evidence together with the written sources is so difficult.

339
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:33,700
But there's one theory I have, which I really like to posit here, and that is that on the way up to Anglesey, the Roman soldiers would have had to pass a place very close to Lindo Moss,

340
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:42,260
which is where Lindo Mann, a sacrificed young man, probably around that time, was found in 1984.

341
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:49,160
And I just wonder whether that was an aversion sacrifice to try and avert that disaster that was about to happen on Anglesey.

342
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,260
Justin Champion, why did the druids went into fairly steep decline, rather quickly?

343
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,260
Can you tell us why?

344
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:04,400
I mean, I'm pretty sure it's the result of Romanisation in both a military sense, but also in a legal sense,

345
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,900
because certainly at some point by the 60s AD, you can't be a Roman citizen and a druid,

346
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,440
so you're narrowing down the opportunities for learned men to go into the sort of business, if you like.

347
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,320
But after Mona, after the destruction at Anglesey...

348
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,220
Anglesey called Mona.

349
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:29,460
It's quite clear that Druidism is trying to be destroyed in all sorts of cultural ways,

350
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:37,280
and we don't really know that much into the early Anglo-Saxon period about what happens to them, I think.

351
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:44,340
But one can imagine, combined with Romanisation, the introduction of Christianity,

352
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:53,080
even if we believe some of the 17th century accounts, even this early, is a rival tradition.

353
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,900
I just wondered if we could perhaps add a little bit to that,

354
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,860
because there are later Roman writers who talk about Druids,

355
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:07,180
and that in itself is interesting because it means that the Druids remain in the Roman consciousness

356
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,020
right to the 4th century AD.

357
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,660
We have a poet called Osonius, a Bordeaux poet,

358
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,000
who wrote a very long treatise about his fellow rhetoricians at the University of Bordeaux,

359
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,860
and he talks about Druids, and by then he's talking of Druids being dynastic,

360
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,540
and the mantle of Druidism falling from father to son.

361
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,140
He actually mentions a number of people in this dynasty.

362
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,040
Now, whether or not these are the same kind of Druids that we would have found in Caesar,

363
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,240
I'm sure they weren't.

364
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,300
But the other interesting thing is a funny lot of documents called the Augustan Histories.

365
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,360
These date the sort of 3rd and 4th centuries AD,

366
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,200
and there are three or four stories about the accession to the purple of emperors like Aurelian,

367
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,220
Numerian and Diocletian,

368
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,540
and that is predicted by Gaulish Druidesses.

369
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,580
So what's interesting for me about that is that,

370
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,600
however much that may have been nonsense,

371
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,160
it means that Druids are still in the consciousness.

372
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,680
Barry Cunliffe,

373
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,160
although I've used the word exterminated,

374
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,280
as I've picked up properly,

375
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
that's not right, really.

376
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,020
They didn't disappear entirely,

377
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,600
and they're still continued in Ireland,

378
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,660
unconquered by the Romans.

379
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,760
Can you give us some idea how they drifted,

380
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,620
and this is ridiculous,

381
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,020
but for the next, well, say, 1,000 years,

382
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,980
after the 3rd, 4th century AD?

383
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,440
Yes, as you say,

384
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,060
they continued in Ireland for a while,

385
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,540
but were gradually turned into insignificance by the rise of Christianity.

386
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,480
But there were the Bards going on.

387
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,500
This Bardic tradition,

388
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
this oral tradition,

389
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,000
was an element of Druidism,

390
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,000
which continued into Irish society,

391
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,460
as indeed it did in Welsh society.

392
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,920
So if you're looking for any real thread of continuity,

393
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,440
the Bardic tradition in those two societies

394
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,620
is as good a thread as you can find,

395
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,460
but the religious overlay

396
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,620
has completely been wiped out by Christianity.

397
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,560
How reliable do you take the Bardic tradition?

398
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,800
Is it reinvented every 50 years,

399
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,860
every two or three generations?

400
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,380
Is there a real continuity?

401
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,400
There is a continuity.

402
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,240
Particularly in Wales,

403
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,380
it had almost died out.

404
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,220
At the Ice Stedfords,

405
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,840
you're getting about six or seven turning up.

406
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,060
When?

407
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,720
What day do we talk about?

408
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,920
We're talking about the 17th century.

409
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,060
The 19th century.

410
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,620
Oh, yes.

411
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,040
In the 18th century,

412
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,940
it begins to take off again

413
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,620
with the whole Celtic revival,

414
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,500
Celtomania.

415
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,120
But still,

416
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,420
we've missed out.

417
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,640
Have you got anything to get hold of

418
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,760
between about 400 AD and the 16th century?

419
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,960
Virtually nothing.

420
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,900
So what you're saying is

421
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,660
when it starts again in the 16th century,

422
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,860
they are making it up

423
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,860
as much as taking it for,

424
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,360
as much as inheriting it.

425
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,000
Yes.

426
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,300
From the 16th century onwards,

427
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,660
people are looking at the classical texts

428
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,060
and they are reinventing

429
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,220
a sort of romantic view of Druidism.

430
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,600
And you've only got these little threads

431
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,480
of things like the Ice Stedford,

432
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,860
like the storytellers,

433
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,420
which are a very pale reflection

434
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,320
of what went before.

435
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,600
Justin Champion,

436
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,660
John Aubrey in the 17th century

437
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,100
became interested in the Druids.

438
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,640
We know him from brief lives,

439
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,420
but he was an antiquarian

440
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,040
and some sort of archaeologist.

441
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,700
And the interest began,

442
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,000
which has never ceased really,

443
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,480
and he was one of the early,

444
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,660
let's call it modern,

445
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,420
persons to revive it.

446
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,180
Can you tell us about,

447
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,360
can you tell us what he did?

448
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,480
Aubrey in one sense

449
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,380
is a great under-explored scholar

450
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,060
and man of learning.

451
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,860
And he represents the sort of legacy

452
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,940
of Renaissance humanism.

453
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,900
As Barry's just said,

454
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,060
all of these classical texts,

455
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,560
whether it's Historia Augusta

456
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,100
or Pliny or Tacitus,

457
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,360
are rediscovered in the 16th century.

458
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,380
And nationalist scholars,

459
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,360
whether they're in France

460
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,740
or in England or in Ireland,

461
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,480
want to make a connection

462
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,540
with those sets of primary documents

463
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,420
and connect them

464
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,920
to their own particular communities.

465
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,520
So we'll get defences

466
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,620
of French Druidry,

467
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,880
English Druidry,

468
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,320
as texture things.

469
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,100
The step that Aubrey takes

470
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,700
is he goes out into the landscape,

471
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,960
to the ruins in the landscape.

472
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,760
He's perhaps the first field archaeologist.

473
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,080
And drawing from hints

474
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,380
from people like Inigo Jones,

475
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,860
who had studied Stonehenge

476
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,260
and was pretty much convinced

477
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,240
it was a Roman temple of some sort,

478
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,420
and reading sort of Danish scholarship

479
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,060
that say, no, no, Stonehenge

480
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,640
is a relic of a Danish conquest.

481
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,520
Aubrey goes out and measures,

482
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,620
draws, maps,

483
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,820
both Stonehenge and Avebury,

484
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,880
and then a whole series of other relics,

485
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,360
and makes the sort of intellectual leap

486
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,820
to connect those early sort of textual sources

487
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,580
with these real artefacts.

488
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,540
And I think from that moment on,

489
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,960
we can see the invention

490
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,240
of a whole series of Druidical practices.

491
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,820
And it's even more brilliant in one sense

492
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,240
that Aubrey is a great draftsman.

493
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,280
He commissions other representations.

494
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,000
And the drawings of Stonehenge

495
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,940
suddenly have little Druidical figures popping up

496
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,180
that he's lifted from another imaginative source.

497
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,900
And those representations persist.

498
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,160
I mean, they're reproduced

499
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,240
in many, many books today,

500
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,140
but they persist as ways of thinking imaginatively

501
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,480
about what Druids were.

502
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,420
Miranda, let's turn to Stonehenge

503
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,120
and William Stukeley

504
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,420
and the association that was there

505
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,160
for quite a while,

506
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,940
that Stonehenge was built by,

507
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,820
part of the Druids' tradition and religion.

508
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:45,760
Yes.

509
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,740
Can you tell this is about Stukeley?

510
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,700
Because Stukeley, as it were,

511
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,780
takes us on from Aubrey.

512
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,800
Stukeley does.

513
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,800
Stukeley's very interesting

514
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,260
because he's born in 1687.

515
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,680
He takes holy orders in 1729

516
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,520
and he becomes a clergyman

517
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,260
who then brings together his two great interests

518
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,100
in ancient religion and archaeology

519
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,740
and megaliths particularly.

520
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,160
And I think when we're thinking about Aubrey

521
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,620
and Stukeley and their fellows,

522
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,840
we have to remember that it's only comparatively recently

523
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,480
that we managed to get a long timeline

524
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,260
back into the remote past for Britain.

525
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,020
Before then, there was no means of, you know,

526
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,580
talking about a deep past,

527
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,180
a deep human past for Britain.

528
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,840
So Stukeley, like Aubrey,

529
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,500
saw Stonehenge as a pre-Roman temple.

530
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,660
The Druids were pre-Roman priests.

531
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,380
Therefore, Stonehenge must be associated with the Druids.

532
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,540
But Stukeley goes one step further.

533
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
He goes a bit strange after a while.

534
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,920
His sermons get more and more Druidic

535
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,960
and he finds an alleged inscription from Dijon

536
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,760
which talks about a Druid called Chindernax.

537
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,500
And Chindernax was a name that Stukeley adopted

538
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,460
and he began to sign his letters,

539
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,100
Your Sincerely Chindernax Druid.

540
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,080
So he didn't find any problem

541
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,980
with being clergymen and Church of England

542
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,820
at the same time.

543
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,740
No, no.

544
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,740
And I think that could have been partly,

545
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,220
if we can go back a little bit,

546
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,920
if you wouldn't mind,

547
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,580
to early Ireland and the interface

548
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,880
between paganism and Christianity.

549
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,420
We have wonderful documents

550
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,440
such as the 7th century lives of Bridget

551
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,140
and Patrick.

552
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,580
And Bridget is a particularly interesting one

553
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,840
because she grows up in a Druid's household

554
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,820
and he becomes Christianised

555
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,840
but remains a Druid.

556
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,860
And there doesn't seem to be a tension

557
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,180
between Christians and Druids.

558
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,180
I think your account of Stukeley is wonderful

559
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,280
and we need to sort of really emphasise

560
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,580
that he is doing Trinitarian archaeology.

561
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,560
Stukeley, in one sense,

562
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,040
subscribes to Usher's view

563
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,560
that the world is only about 6,000 years old.

564
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,480
So you've got to fit all of these things

565
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,300
from Adam to Moses to the Druids to now

566
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,780
into that chronology.

567
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,580
And he's reacting very, very much

568
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,760
against some of the deistical accounts

569
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,800
of the Druids as wicked pagan priests.

570
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,700
So Druidism is a form of patriarchal,

571
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,840
Abramic worship.

572
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,000
And it's not just Stukeley.

573
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,200
People like Isaac Newton,

574
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,420
supposed modern rationalists,

575
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,160
see Stonehenge as the remnants

576
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,140
of sort of ancient fire worship

577
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,940
that is only then contaminated

578
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,260
by corrupt Christianity.

579
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,100
Barrick, on Stonehenge,

580
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,560
it's been discredited that the Druids

581
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,900
could possibly have built Stonehenge.

582
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,440
It was built, hasn't it?

583
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:33,800
No.

584
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,940
Oh, I thought it was.

585
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,180
No, no.

586
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,460
Well, one of you told me that.

587
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,300
No, well, I think...

588
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,380
Who is a guilty contributor?

589
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,780
Yeah, there's some new ideas here

590
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,680
we've got to explore, I think.

591
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,360
The idea that Druids are to be related

592
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,240
with Latane culture, I think,

593
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,100
is an idea of the 50s and 60s

594
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,800
of the last century,

595
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,900
and most archaeologists have thrown that out.

596
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
If we try and find out...

597
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,280
If we look at the development

598
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,840
of religious structures

599
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,500
and behaviour in Britain

600
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,340
and look at what was happening

601
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,840
in the first century BC

602
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,000
when there were Druids

603
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,740
and then try and back-project

604
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,760
those behaviour patterns,

605
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
we can see that some elements

606
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,420
of the belief systems of the Druids,

607
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,320
cosmology, for example,

608
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,620
can be dated right back

609
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,040
to at least 3000 BC in Britain.

610
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,020
Some of the practices

611
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,740
of digging deep shafts

612
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,800
and putting offerings in them,

613
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,880
again, can go back

614
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,720
to the 3rd or 2nd millennium.

615
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,140
So I think there is a good case

616
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,000
to be made out

617
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,400
for the belief systems

618
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,300
of the Druids

619
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,420
from the 4th or 3rd centuries BC

620
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,940
are deeply rooted

621
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,280
in the belief systems

622
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,200
of the area

623
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,320
that go right back

624
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,440
into the Neolithic period.

625
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,420
But Stonehenge

626
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,280
is so emblematic.

627
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,520
Can you just...

628
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,280
You said...

629
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,160
Yes, they might...

630
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,060
Look, I'm...

631
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,140
There's a revolution

632
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,840
going on in my head.

633
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,360
I came here all prepared to put...

634
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,620
All right.

635
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,700
You say that they could have

636
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
had a hand in building it.

637
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,720
Or they could have built it.

638
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,220
Could be that.

639
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,200
No, no, not quite.

640
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,820
You're putting words

641
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,420
in my mouth here.

642
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,060
No, what I'm saying

643
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,500
is that the religious beliefs

644
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,800
which later are practiced

645
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,740
by the Druids

646
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,080
might be very deep-rooted

647
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,560
in Britain

648
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,760
and might be reflected

649
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,620
in buildings like Stonehenge.

650
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,580
Now, whether they were

651
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,140
calling themselves Druids

652
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,700
at that time,

653
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,720
who knows?

654
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,880
But we've got to look

655
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,460
for the roots

656
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,940
of these belief systems

657
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,300
and the roots go back in time.

658
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,840
Would it be fair to say, then,

659
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,080
that the Druids adopted Stonehenge

660
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,960
and for...

661
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,800
You're shaking your head again.

662
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,440
No.

663
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,120
Strangely enough,

664
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,560
there's no real evidence,

665
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,360
very little evidence...

666
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,080
Well, when did the...

667
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,040
We now think of Stonehenge

668
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,920
and the Druids together.

669
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,240
OK.

670
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,000
Well, let's get to...

671
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,360
Let me get to the hinge of it.

672
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:53,600
OK.

673
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,440
When did that happen?

674
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,340
Right.

675
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,760
People like Aubrey,

676
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,740
people like Stukley

677
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,180
came up with the idea

678
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,940
that Stonehenge

679
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,500
and Avebury

680
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,540
were the temples

681
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,280
of the Druids.

682
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,880
And that idea

683
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,320
has pervaded

684
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,020
scholarly and less scholarly

685
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,760
thought since then.

686
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,960
Now, what I'm saying...

687
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,140
Archaeologists have come in

688
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,540
and said,

689
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,440
absolute rubbish,

690
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,200
there are only Druids

691
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,240
from the 4th century BC.

692
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,560
Stonehenge is a lot earlier

693
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:23,920
than that,

694
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,580
so it can't be.

695
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,160
What I'm saying

696
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,840
with a number

697
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,580
of other archaeologists

698
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,840
is that the roots

699
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,660
go back deeper

700
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,980
and it's not impossible

701
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,660
that rituals

702
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,660
similar to those

703
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,920
of the Druidic rituals

704
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,000
were associated

705
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,660
with the building

706
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,040
and the early use

707
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,660
of Stonehenge.

708
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,320
I think, Barry,

709
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,860
that's why

710
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,400
the other figure

711
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,460
we could talk about,

712
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,200
John Toland,

713
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,760
is so interesting

714
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,780
because although

715
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,820
his critical history

716
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,540
of the Druids

717
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,260
and a specimen

718
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,200
of Celtic learning

719
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
is probably,

720
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,180
at the end of the day,

721
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,000
nothing more

722
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,500
than a very,

723
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,720
very elaborate joke

724
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,980
but a very

725
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,720
extraordinarily learned one,

726
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,920
he represents

727
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,800
some sort of early

728
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,260
pre-Egyptian,

729
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,340
pre-Pythagorean Druidism

730
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,640
taking place

731
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,740
not just in Ireland,

732
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,700
not just in Wales,

733
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,760
but certainly in Scotland

734
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,320
and he confects

735
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,020
this entire sort of

736
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,800
early Druid republic

737
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,440
where everything

738
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,180
is godly

739
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,620
and virtuous.

740
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,440
We've missed

741
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,280
our human sacrifice

742
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,900
and we haven't got

743
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,300
much time.

744
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,140
We've got to turn to it

745
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,740
because it's part

746
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,300
of the story.

747
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,040
They were accused of,

748
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,260
well,

749
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:29,960
there's been human

750
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,900
sacrifice in so many

751
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,700
religions and they

752
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,140
continue.

753
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,180
Can you,

754
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,660
and it was thought

755
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,860
by some early writers

756
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,960
and some early commentators,

757
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
was this black propaganda

758
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,560
that Miranda

759
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,280
you're going to tell us,

760
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,880
as being excessive,

761
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,540
that altars ran with blood,

762
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,620
that sort of thing.

763
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,000
What about human sacrifice

764
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,620
and the Druids?

765
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,180
What do we know?

766
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,780
I think it's fair to say

767
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,700
that human sacrifice

768
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,960
probably did take place.

769
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,480
There is some

770
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,200
archaeological evidence

771
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,780
for it,

772
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,320
for example,

773
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,060
in the bog bodies

774
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,420
places like Lindo Moss

775
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,300
that I've mentioned before

776
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,340
and quite a lot

777
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,240
of other evidence

778
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,700
but the archaeological

779
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,940
evidence suggests

780
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,060
that it was happening

781
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,060
but it was rare

782
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,340
and it would only happen

783
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,440
at times of great crisis

784
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,860
and I think what's happened

785
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,620
is that when Caesar

786
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,340
talks about it,

787
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,060
he talks about it

788
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,220
in a very matter-of-fact way.

789
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,240
He says it is,

790
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,300
the Druids find it

791
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,060
appropriate to sacrifice

792
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,700
human beings

793
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,120
for efficacious purposes.

794
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,460
They would try and use

795
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,140
prisoners of war

796
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,600
or criminals

797
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,280
but if there weren't

798
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,580
enough

799
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,520
then the innocents

800
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,320
would make up

801
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,740
the numbers.

802
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,060
He's very pragmatic

803
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,640
about this.

804
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,540
We have to remember

805
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,860
that human sacrifice

806
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,440
was only outlawed

807
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,700
in Rome in 97 BC,

808
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,860
not that long ago

809
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,960
before Caesar.

810
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,620
The other writers

811
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,240
like Pliny,

812
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,920
like Tacitus,

813
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,580
like Lucan,

814
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,660
they do sort of

815
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,580
talk it up a bit.

816
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,460
They do talk about

817
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,460
altars running with blood

818
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,360
but I think human sacrifice

819
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,300
did take place

820
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,080
but it was not

821
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,660
that out of the ordinary.

822
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,240
It was not

823
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,980
that big a deal.

824
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,580
Barry?

825
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,340
Barry Conner?

826
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:54,760
Yes,

827
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,140
there is evidence

828
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,400
in Iron Age archaeology

829
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,440
that bodies,

830
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,200
people were sacrificed

831
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,640
I think.

832
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,720
I excavated some pits

833
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,540
in a hill fort

834
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,180
called Dainbury

835
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,560
where there are bodies

836
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,380
thrown into the bottoms

837
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:10,960
of pits

838
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,940
with stones

839
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,980
heaped down on them.

840
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Now that doesn't look

841
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,040
very much like

842
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,260
normal burial practice

843
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,240
so there are hints

844
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,760
like that

845
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,840
in the archaeological evidence

846
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
and indeed

847
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,560
the bog bodies

848
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,660
but I think Miranda

849
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,740
is absolutely right

850
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,620
that this was an extreme.

851
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,220
This was what you did

852
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,440
when things were going

853
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,760
really got bad

854
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,300
and you had to placate

855
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:31,780
the gods

856
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,280
rather like the Carthaginians

857
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,860
sacrificing their kids

858
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,000
when things went bad.

859
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,720
I think one of the

860
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,460
interesting things

861
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,360
is that the 18th

862
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,120
and 19th century

863
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,420
aren't really interested

864
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,760
in Druids as sacrifices.

865
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,500
They're interested

866
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,320
in Druids as recoverers

867
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,940
of some sort of

868
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,760
natural spirit

869
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,580
and the huge sort of effort

870
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,900
into reconstructing

871
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,640
Druidical temples

872
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,380
and saving land

873
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,300
Exactly

874
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,500
so they're communing

875
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,080
with nature

876
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,200
they're the sort of

877
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,280
early ecological

878
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,020
sort of warriors

879
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,600
in one sense.

880
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,620
Yes they are very much so

881
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,800
and these holy sites

882
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,920
become preserved sites

883
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,340
and the idea of preserving sites

884
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,540
owes a lot to that.

885
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,300
And even to the lengths

886
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,700
of very wealthy aristocrats

887
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,960
importing from Brittany

888
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,540
and elsewhere

889
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
sacred sites

890
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,560
and reconstructing them

891
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,940
in their own sort of land.

892
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,060
Well thank you very much

896
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,900
next year we'll be talking

897
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,900
about the ontological argument

898
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,680
first outlined

899
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,620
in the 7th century

900
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,760
by Anselm

901
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
the argument

902
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,380
is an attempt

903
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,300
to prove the existence

904
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:25,820
of God

905
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,840
through reason alone.

906
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,580
Thanks for listening.

For years

917
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,900
I've sounded like

918
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,700
a broken record.

919
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,460
I do not want kids.

920
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,340
I do not ever want

921
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,820
I don't want to have a kid

922
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,500
don't want to have a kid

923
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,200
don't want to have a kid

924
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,960
I'm in my 40s now

925
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,520
the door is almost closed

926
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,060
and suddenly

927
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,420
I'm not so sure

928
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,060
the story has

929
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,280
always been no

930
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,880
I'm just wondering

931
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,080
to what degree

932
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,300
it's just a story.

933
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,100
Definitely just a story.
