# The ECB during the Euro Crisis and its Future Role in Global Disruption
---
by  [Jean-Claude Trichet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Trichet)
## Past of ECB and Euro

- started as the friendship between **Germany and France**
- [*Jean Monnet* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Monnet) was the first-ever individual to be designated as an [Honorary Citizen of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_Citizen_of_Europe "Honorary Citizen of Europe") in 1976.
- Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus - crisis
- **Greece**: The crisis led to a severe economic downturn and massive job losses. Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio jumped from 127% in 2009 to about 170% due to GDP drop.23
- **Ireland**: Followed Greece in requiring a bailout in November 2010. Ireland's recovery started in 2012 to 2014, partly due to its banking crisis.35
- **Portugal**: Required a bailout in May 2011. Portugal's recovery began in 2012 to 2014, and the country has performed strongly since 2019.
- **Cyprus**: Like Ireland and Portugal, Cyprus began its recovery between 2012 and 2014. The country faced harsh terms for its €10 billion rescue package, including raising a similar amount, closing its failing second-largest bank, and implementing structural reforms.

### Causes:

- **High Public Debt:**
	Several eurozone member states, including Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus, accumulated significant public debt, exceeding the limits set by the Maastricht Treaty. 
    
- **Financial Instability:**
	A burst housing bubble in Spain, a shattered domestic banking sector in Ireland, sluggish economic growth in Portugal and Italy, and ineffective tax collection in Greece contributed to the crisis. 
    
- **Failure to Comply with Maastricht Treaty Guidelines:**
	Many member countries, including Greece, consistently failed to meet the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty, which included maintaining annual budget deficits that did not exceed 3 percent of GDP and ensuring that public debt did not exceed 60 percent of GDP. 
    
- **Loss of Market Access:**
	During the crisis, these countries faced difficulties accessing capital markets, leading to a breakdown of their ability to refinance their debts. 
    
- **Global Financial Crisis:**
	The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the subsequent Great Recession exacerbated the problems of these countries. 
    
###  Key Events and Outcomes:

- **Bailouts:**
	Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus requested and received financial assistance from the [Troika (European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troika_(European_group)) in the form of bailouts. 
    
- **Austerity Measures:**
	As a condition for the bailouts, these countries were forced to implement austerity measures, including cuts to public spending and wages, which led to social unrest and economic hardship. 
    
- **Economic Contractions and Job Losses:**
	All four countries experienced severe economic downturns with massive job losses. 
    
- **Recovery:**
    After a period of crisis and austerity, all four countries began to recover, with Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus recovering more quickly than Greece. 
    
- **Political Crises:**
    Political instability and crises further worsened the situation in Greece. 
    
- **Strengthening of the Eurozone:**
    The crisis led to reforms and strengthening of the Eurozone's financial architecture, including the creation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). 
    
- **Recapitalization of Banks:**
    Banks in these countries were recapitalized and the regulatory framework was strengthened, increasing confidence in the banking sector.
