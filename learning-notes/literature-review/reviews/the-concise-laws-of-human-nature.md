# The Concise Laws of Human Nature - Robert Greene
---

- “Or perhaps we fall in love with a person who is precisely the wrong type for us and we know it, but we cannot help ourselves. What has come over us, we wonder?”

- “We settle for the easiest and most convenient story to tell ourselves.”

- “We would not allow ourselves to get dragged into their dramas, knowing in advance that our interest is what they depend on for their control.”

- “What if we could understand why we are so compelled to desire what other people have, or to identify so strongly with a group that we feel contempt for those who are on the outside? What if we could find out what causes us to lie about who we are, or to inadvertently push people away”

- “ a common misconception: we tend to think of our behavior as largely conscious and willed.”

- “we humans remain highly susceptible to the moods and emotions of those around us, compelling all kinds of behavior on our part—unconsciously imitating others, wanting what they have, getting swept up in viral feelings of anger or outrage.”

- “ Notice how our propensities to compare ourselves with others, to feel envy, and to seek status through attention have only become intensified with our ability to communicate so quickly with so many people.”

- “Trust your feelings!”—But feelings are nothing final or original; behind feelings there stand judgments and evaluations which we inherit in the form of … inclinations, aversions … The inspiration born of a feeling is the grandchild of a judgement—and often of a false judgment!—and in any event not a child of your own! To trust one’s feelings—means to give more obedience to one’s grandfather and grandmother and their grandparents than to the gods which are in us: our reason and our experience.”

- “We constantly feel emotions, and they continually infect our thinking, making us veer toward thoughts that please us and soothe our egos.”

- “the most common emotion of them all is the desire for pleasure and the avoidance of pain.”

- “a realistic appraisal of themselves and their weaknesses; a devotion to truth and reality; a tolerant attitude toward people; and the ability to reach goals that they have set.”

- “First, people have trained themselves in social situations to present the front that is appropriate and that will be judged positively. Second, we are prone to fall for the **halo effect**—when we see certain negative or positive qualities in a person (social awkwardness, intelligence), other positive or negative qualities are implied that fit with this.”
