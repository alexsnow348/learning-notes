# Time Series
-----
- discrete and continuous data
- state space models (discrete/continuous data)
- discrete Kalman filter : designed to estimate the hidden states of the system, even when the measurements are imprecise and uncertain. [Kalman filter](https://www.kalmanfilter.net/background.html)
- standard RNN
- sequence to sequence 
	- transformer
	- attention mechanism 
- CNN
## Problems
- Missing Values
- Probabilistic forecasting/ Uncertainty quantification : instead of predicting y_k , predict P(y_k)
- Hierarchical time series
- Incorparatity   "inductive biases": add assumptions to model from domain experts
