This BBC podcast is supported by ads outside the UK.

00:06.100 --> 00:08.660
For years, I've sounded like a broken record.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.400
I do not want kids.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.820
I do not ever want to have kids.

00:11.900 --> 00:14.120
I don't want to have a kid, don't want to have a kid, don't want to have a kid.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.460
I'm in my 40s now. The door is almost closed.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.340
And suddenly, I'm not so sure.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.200
The story has always been no.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.180
I'm just wondering to what degree it's just a story.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.020
Definitely just a story.

00:29.020 --> 00:32.920
From CBC's Personally, this is Creation Myth.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.680
Available now wherever you get your podcasts.

00:59.020 --> 01:05.960
And their victims were the Druids, an ancient religious order which was ruthlessly eliminated from Roman Britain.

01:05.960 --> 01:10.620
The Druids were active in Britain, Ireland and Gaul and flourished for many centuries.

01:11.140 --> 01:16.260
They were reasonably well chronicled by ancient authors including Julius Caesar and Posidonius.

01:16.880 --> 01:21.940
Much later, thanks to a revival of interest in the 17th century, they inspired a wealth of literature and art.

01:21.940 --> 01:30.640
But because the Druids were an oral culture and left no written records of their own, comparatively little is known about their beliefs and practices.

01:31.160 --> 01:37.040
And the reinventions of the Druidical traditions by Romantic writers have resulted in much misconception and myth.

01:37.040 --> 01:44.760
With me to discuss the ancient Druids are Justin Champion, Professor of the History of Early Modern Ideas at Royal Holloway, University of London.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.740
Barry Cunliffe, Emeritus Professor of European Archaeology at the University of Oxford.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.480
And Miranda Oldhouse-Green, Professor of Archaeology at Cardiff University.

01:54.980 --> 01:58.640
Justin Champion, who were the Druids and where did they live?

01:58.640 --> 02:05.540
The Druids really, I think, flourished between the late 4th century BC and the end of the 2nd century AD.

02:05.980 --> 02:10.760
They're predominantly map onto the late Iron Age culture called Latin.

02:11.880 --> 02:18.360
They're very eminent in England, in Britain, in Wales and in Brittany, in Gaul.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.520
So they cover that period.

02:20.520 --> 02:27.480
The problem we have is that the sources, the literary sources that expose their traditions are very, very fragmentary.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.420
They're palimpsests, written over earlier traditions.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.980
We know Druids existed in this culture because we can look at place names.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.240
We can look at the spread of Celtic language.

02:37.660 --> 02:40.860
But actually identifying the key areas is quite difficult.

02:41.620 --> 02:45.480
One of the problems we have is that they were a determinedly oral culture.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.860
Can you tell us why they were and what the consequence of that is?

02:50.240 --> 02:53.820
Well, one of the problems is that they are a priesthood of some sort.

02:53.820 --> 03:00.440
And they believe that they understand deep secret knowledge and that they pass it on to people of their own ilk.

03:00.920 --> 03:09.740
That means that they don't leave artifacts and texts for us to study as modern historians and archaeologists.

03:09.880 --> 03:22.140
And one of the problems is, is trying to coordinate the reportage of Druids in figures like Caesar and Pliny later with some of the archaeological temples and buildings that we know.

03:22.140 --> 03:29.880
And certainly later on in the period, the 17th and 18th century, there's huge amounts of speculation about connecting that oral culture.

03:30.380 --> 03:38.540
Of course, there are traditions in the early medieval periods that somehow draw from an oral tradition, particularly in Ireland.

03:38.920 --> 03:43.240
And those, again, are exploited by 17th and 18th century figures.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.800
But it's a very, very mysterious business.

03:46.080 --> 03:50.400
Can we just go back for a moment or two, just not go back, go to this oral tradition idea?

03:50.540 --> 03:58.860
Because many, many civilizations are remote from us because of their insistence on an oral tradition, which is fascinating.

03:59.460 --> 04:00.660
You said they were priesthood.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.040
They wanted to keep it among themselves.

04:02.380 --> 04:07.540
But in a way, I think it I've read anyway, it's more extensive and deeper than that.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.260
Can you just dwell on that for a moment or two?

04:09.260 --> 04:19.680
I think one of the things that we we have difficulty with is, of course, Christianity became so dominant, even in the early centuries after Christ.

04:19.860 --> 04:28.460
And that one of the projects that the Roman Empire alongside Christianity has was to actually obscure many, many aspects of that oral culture.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.880
It has to be sort of destroyed.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.140
It hasn't got to the point of why they insisted on it.

04:32.140 --> 04:40.780
I've read it's because they thought that the writing was lazy, that they thought that writing was open to misinterpretations, which oral culture wasn't.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.520
And are these any explanations?

04:42.520 --> 04:44.740
Those are good, plausible explanations.

04:45.200 --> 04:54.780
And certainly the Druids, because they read nature, they read sort of deeper philosophy, want to be able to communicate effectively with their local communities.

04:54.780 --> 04:59.900
And, of course, writing is open to rhetoric and to exploitation.

05:00.120 --> 05:10.780
There is one tradition, though, that says Druid thinking is captured in this mysterious language called Ogham, little marks on wooden sticks and on stones.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.280
But, of course, we don't actually know very much about Ogham script itself.

05:14.540 --> 05:20.220
And the invention of an oral tradition captured in that form is very much a 17th century tradition.

05:20.220 --> 05:25.560
Barry Cunliffe, can you tell us then about the earliest chronicled references to the Druids?

05:26.080 --> 05:32.920
Well, as Justin said, we've got lots of snippets of information about the Druids spread across a number of classical writers.

05:33.940 --> 05:44.220
But from about the 1st century BC to about the 7th century AD, most of those classical writers are quoting secondhand, thirdhand, fourthhand from other classical writers.

05:44.220 --> 05:54.580
So the game, really, is to try and sort out when the first and when the inputs of new information about the Druids sort of hit the literary world.

05:55.160 --> 06:10.960
I think one could argue that the first input of real information comes around 300 BC with the journeys of a very remarkable man called Pythias who lived in Marseille.

06:10.960 --> 06:16.020
He was a Greek. And he made a journey. We know about this journey.

06:16.100 --> 06:19.540
He made a journey. I think he was trying to work out where the tin came from.

06:19.640 --> 06:23.360
Tin was very important for the Greek economy. And it was coming from the northwest.

06:23.920 --> 06:38.780
So he traveled through France, got into the Atlantic, probably took local boats, went to Brittany, crossed to Cornwall, up the Irish Sea, to the Northern Isles, down the east coast of Britain, down the Channel, and back to Brittany.

06:38.780 --> 06:42.800
Back to Marseille, where he wrote a book called On the Ocean.

06:43.440 --> 06:52.880
Now, that was the main source of information about the northwest of Europe, the Atlantic shores of Europe.

06:53.420 --> 06:55.420
And that book, On the Ocean, we don't have.

06:55.780 --> 06:58.560
But lots of other people started to use it as a source.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.780
People like Timaeus, who was a Sicilian historian.

07:01.780 --> 07:10.580
And people like Eratosthenes, a very interesting man around 200 BC, he was the librarian, chief librarian at Alexandria.

07:11.160 --> 07:14.860
And people like that were using this early source.

07:14.860 --> 07:16.560
And what were they finding about Druids in his account?

07:16.660 --> 07:18.660
They were finding a lot about Britain.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.880
And they were picking up little snippets of information about Druids.

07:22.880 --> 07:29.280
And particularly, the theme that comes over is Druids as philosophers, as natural philosophers.

07:29.760 --> 07:33.900
This is the early, let's call this the early Greek tradition, the Greek or Alexandrian tradition.

07:34.420 --> 07:39.580
And that really does focus, not on all the ritual and blood and things like that.

07:39.740 --> 07:43.300
It focuses on the intellectual quality of the Druid.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.140
And the Greeks were very impressed.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.700
They compared Druids rather to Pythagoras.

07:47.700 --> 07:55.020
And Druids had these strange ideas that the soul was immortal, and so on.

07:55.220 --> 08:00.080
Did Posidonius later, was it two centuries later, did he take up, did he build on Pythagoras' ideas?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.760
He was an anthropologist, or did he do some original work of his own?

08:02.880 --> 08:06.020
No, Posidonius was the next sort of input of new information.

08:06.360 --> 08:12.080
Posidonius was a Stoic philosopher from Apamea in Syria.

08:12.080 --> 08:12.740
He was Greek.

08:13.140 --> 08:20.260
But he spent most of his time on the island of Rhodes, in the sort of university atmosphere of Rhodes.

08:20.540 --> 08:23.000
But he was writing a history of the ancient world.

08:23.340 --> 08:26.080
And like a good historian, he actually did his fieldwork.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.180
And one of the bits of fieldwork he did was to go to southern France, Gaul,

08:30.740 --> 08:35.500
when just a generation after the Romans had just taken over that southern strip of France,

08:36.020 --> 08:39.760
ostensibly to work out how Hannibal got through the Alps and so on.

08:39.800 --> 08:40.700
He was writing about that.

08:40.700 --> 08:45.840
And he came across Celts and observed the habits of the Celts and the Druids and so on.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.760
And he put a lot of new information into the pot.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.580
What are the likely origins, the deep origins?

08:51.740 --> 08:56.380
You've mentioned Pythagoras, the claims that it goes back to Moses, 13th century BC,

08:56.560 --> 08:59.580
that it even goes back to Egypt, the Druid tradition.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.240
Now, what are we to make of that?

09:01.340 --> 09:03.440
What do you see as the origins?

09:04.260 --> 09:06.100
Well, I think I can just take the evidence.

09:06.100 --> 09:16.840
And what we've got to live with is a remark by Julius Caesar that the Druids originated in Britain.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.200
And if you want to study the Druids, you've got to go to Britain to do so.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.000
Now, we don't have to believe everything Caesar says.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.980
Why did this business of Egypt, Moses and Pythagoras come in then?

09:26.980 --> 09:32.080
Well, it was the later Greek writers who were looking back...

09:32.080 --> 09:33.380
Was it Strabo and people like that?

09:33.380 --> 09:40.100
No, people like Clement of Alexandria and some of the later Christians looking back on this

09:40.100 --> 09:48.240
and saying that really the beliefs of the Druids were so much like Pythagoras

09:48.240 --> 09:53.060
that either Pythagoras got them from the Druids or the other way around.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.480
Belief being the transmigration of the cell, for instance.

09:55.620 --> 09:56.800
That's right, that sort of thing.

09:57.680 --> 10:04.340
But where the origin of the Druid belief came from, as Justin said,

10:04.500 --> 10:08.220
it's concentrated in Britain, Ireland and France.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.940
And that's where most of the place names, most of the evidence is.

10:11.940 --> 10:18.240
And I think if you look, take Caesar's view that they might have originated in Britain.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.300
Caesar, can I go across to Miranda for Caesar, Barry?

10:21.500 --> 10:21.820
Do you mind?

10:22.160 --> 10:29.100
Miranda, so we've got Caesar who gives us a very, quite a detailed account,

10:29.260 --> 10:30.200
chronicle of the Druids.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.220
Can you just tell listeners what he says about them?

10:32.760 --> 10:32.920
Yes.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.160
We take it he's a reasonably reliable historian.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.100
He was on the case.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.360
He was in Gaul for eight years.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.880
He knew about this country as well.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.640
Yes, he was in Gaul for about sort of eight or nine years in the 50s BC.

10:44.560 --> 10:50.120
He was a Roman general and he wrote a war commentary called the Gallic Wars or De Bello Gallico.

10:51.260 --> 10:57.100
And he, most of the books, there are seven books written by him in his lifetime and then one posthumous one.

10:57.880 --> 11:02.280
But in book six, he digresses from his normal war diaries where he's talking about, you know,

11:02.320 --> 11:04.340
conquering different tribes and polities in Gaul.

11:04.340 --> 11:11.200
And he digresses to talk about customs and practices of Gauls and Germans and Britons to an extent.

11:12.200 --> 11:18.180
And there's a quite a long piece in book six about the society in Gaul at the time he was writing.

11:18.920 --> 11:23.260
And he says very tellingly that there were only two lots of people of any account, the Knights and the Druids.

11:23.260 --> 11:26.420
And he's obviously far more interested in the Druids than anybody else.

11:26.940 --> 11:34.160
He says they're in charge of all religious practices, that they are judges, they are teachers, they are natural scientists, they study the cosmos.

11:34.920 --> 11:39.580
And they were immensely influential in all political and religious matters.

11:40.540 --> 11:42.980
And Caesar is quite clearly quite impressed with them.

11:42.980 --> 11:50.620
We learned later on, or not actually, but earlier on in the commentaries, that he had a very good friend called Diviciarchus,

11:50.900 --> 11:53.720
who was the leader of a Burgundian tribe called the Aedui.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.620
It's a Romanised name of a Celt.

11:57.820 --> 12:00.360
Of a Celtic tribe, Diviciarchus, yes, indeed.

12:00.840 --> 12:05.100
And he was a leader, but he was also in charge of religion.

12:05.100 --> 12:16.180
And Cicero picks up Diviciarchus, who visited Rome in 60 BC, and Cicero meets him and talks about what an impressive person he is

12:16.180 --> 12:20.740
and how good he is at divining the future, how good he is at augury, and he was a Druid.

12:21.500 --> 12:26.400
So Caesar has this powerful ally, Diviciarchus, whom Cicero picks up on.

12:26.400 --> 12:36.380
And the general impression you get from Caesar is that they are impressive intellectuals, they are worthy of Caesar's interest.

12:37.400 --> 12:43.580
He also picks up on this business about oral tradition, Caesar, and he says quite clearly there are two reasons for lack of writing.

12:44.100 --> 12:47.800
One is secrecy and the need to keep knowledge to the few.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.620
And the second is to train memory.

12:51.620 --> 12:57.800
And I think the whole idea about the Druids is that they are keepers of ancestral tradition.

12:58.320 --> 13:02.280
They are, in a sense, the keepers of the culture of the communities in which they operated.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.480
Is there any corroboration?

13:04.580 --> 13:11.540
I mean, the interesting thing about Caesar's chronicle, apart from its interest, from what he says, is that it is detailed.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.020
He claims an awful lot.

13:13.380 --> 13:15.440
He makes a very grand claim for the Druids.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.200
Is there any corroboration?

13:17.360 --> 13:17.980
Is he alone?

13:18.240 --> 13:20.240
What reasons do you have for believing him?

13:20.240 --> 13:29.680
I think partly because he was surrounded by fellow Romans of similar status to himself.

13:30.500 --> 13:37.820
He was writing his commentaries specifically to justify what were slightly dodgy actions in Gaul.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.880
He didn't really have a mandate from the Senate for what he was doing in Gaul.

13:41.560 --> 13:45.720
And I think part of the commentaries, part of the purpose of the commentaries was to legitimize what he was doing.

13:46.340 --> 13:49.020
But he had people with him like Cicero's brother Quintus.

13:49.020 --> 13:55.940
And I think had he sort of made it all up, I think people might have actually rumbled him and said something.

13:56.540 --> 14:03.360
So although some of it may be sort of flannel and embroidery, I think he's one of our best sources.

14:03.360 --> 14:10.380
Because the great thing about Caesar is he's writing at the time when the Druids were particularly prevalent.

14:10.380 --> 14:18.120
What evidence did he put forward, if he put forward any evidence, that this had begun, the origin of the thing in north-west Europe was in Britain?

14:18.800 --> 14:24.660
He actually says it is thought that Druidry began in Britain and was exported to Gaul.

14:24.940 --> 14:29.160
And that's actually quite interesting because later on Pliny, who's another source of the Druids...

14:29.160 --> 14:29.260
Pliny the Elder.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.180
Pliny the Elder actually says exactly the opposite.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.260
So who knows?

14:34.260 --> 14:39.600
After Caesar, are there any classical authors who are as detailed and as convincing?

14:40.560 --> 14:44.640
Not as detailed, but Pliny is quite...

14:44.640 --> 14:45.400
He's quite interesting.

14:45.820 --> 14:52.040
The later writers in the 1st century AD, there's a subtle change in how Druids are regarded by Romans.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.360
So Caesar is fairly complementary about them.

14:55.720 --> 15:00.560
People like Pliny, Tacitus and Lucan in the 1st century AD are fairly anti them.

15:00.560 --> 15:06.640
And what you're getting now is the barbarian, the savage, human sacrifices talked up.

15:06.920 --> 15:11.300
Is it propaganda or do you think it's a more realistic, more truthful analysis?

15:11.980 --> 15:14.280
Well, a bit of both, I think.

15:14.520 --> 15:15.720
Because the Romans didn't...

15:15.720 --> 15:18.900
We're coming to that, but the Romans found the Druids an obstacle when they came to this country.

15:19.240 --> 15:23.740
I think, yes, I think the Romans found the Druids a bit of a pain, partly because they were very highly nationalistic

15:23.740 --> 15:28.760
and were clearly focuses of sedition and rebellion.

15:28.760 --> 15:33.600
So when you are annexing a province, the last thing you want is Druids in people's ears going,

15:33.720 --> 15:34.560
no, we don't want that.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.120
And, of course, it's in the Druids' best interests for Rome not to succeed

15:38.120 --> 15:40.320
because the whole of their power base would go.

15:40.960 --> 15:46.760
Druids' power depends upon Gallic society and British society being hierarchical, highly stratified.

15:47.120 --> 15:51.620
Once you bring Romans into the mix, the whole of society falls apart and is reinvented.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.100
And there is no place for Druids in that.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.200
So we're talking about the beginnings of a sort of propaganda.

15:55.200 --> 16:00.660
And before we move on, when you say Davidiacus, Davidiacus met Cicero in Rome,

16:00.740 --> 16:02.020
which language did they speak in?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.160
Ah, Latin.

16:03.620 --> 16:03.840
Right.

16:04.420 --> 16:05.540
So the Druids knew Latin.

16:05.900 --> 16:06.160
OK.

16:06.920 --> 16:07.540
Well, enough.

16:07.940 --> 16:10.080
If you can talk to Cicero, you're not doing badly.

16:10.080 --> 16:10.800
No, indeed not.

16:11.360 --> 16:11.740
OK.

16:12.260 --> 16:16.940
Justin, Justin Champion, let's develop the idea of the Druids in society in Britain.

16:16.940 --> 16:18.840
And we know quite a bit now.

16:18.980 --> 16:20.600
So you just developed that.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.640
How powerful were they?

16:21.840 --> 16:23.580
The word power has been mentioned by Miranda.

16:23.900 --> 16:29.240
I think, once again, we've got to be very cautious because we're drawing from these little fragments of sources

16:29.240 --> 16:30.620
and sort of stitching them together.

16:30.820 --> 16:34.440
You know, if we believe Caesar, the Druids are very highly organised.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.860
You know, they have annual meetings.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.120
They're arch-Druids.

16:37.120 --> 16:42.160
They elect, they sort of confer and communicate across Gaul and Britain.

16:43.180 --> 16:51.960
Within those societies, though, as Miranda said, that they are judges, they're teachers, they're motivators in some sense.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.220
And I think that's one of the reasons why the Romans have difficulties with them.

16:55.480 --> 17:00.500
The doctrine of the transmigration of the souls, I think it's Caesar says, makes men very brave.

17:00.860 --> 17:07.040
Because if you know you may come back, then you're not going to be afraid to die in a war defending your own sort of community.

17:07.120 --> 17:12.200
So I think we can think of the Druids as experts.

17:12.980 --> 17:15.220
You know, they're not quite priests.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.440
They're more than priests.

17:17.500 --> 17:25.320
Certainly, as Pliny and the later sources expound and embroider on, they're involved with medical practice.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.660
They're judges.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.760
They're people who will negotiate between strife within communities.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.260
So they're very powerful figures.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.420
Caesar describes two sorts, knights and Druids.

17:35.420 --> 17:45.800
Certainly, I think, after the Christian era, Druids are more and more marginalised and are starting to be thought of as sort of slightly odd magicians.

17:45.980 --> 17:48.740
You know, they retreat, perhaps, out of communities.

17:49.520 --> 17:55.600
So they're very powerful figures that we don't quite have a modern equivalent for, I think.

17:55.600 --> 18:02.660
What do we know about the Druids' beliefs and rituals, then, Barry Cunner?

18:03.760 --> 18:05.340
Well, strangely, very little.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.660
We can pick up bits of it.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.980
The Druid has...

18:10.980 --> 18:17.500
If you're communicating as an ordinary person with the gods, you can only do so through the Druid.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.320
So the Druid is an intermediary to start with.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.040
So I want you to...

18:20.040 --> 18:22.380
That's one point I was hesitating, stumbling off.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.180
We're just in there.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.360
But let's take it with you.

18:25.060 --> 18:32.020
Was it a prime source of their power that they were, your word, the intermediaries between the gods and the...

18:32.020 --> 18:32.820
They could do it.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.000
They could take you to God.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.900
They could tell you what God wanted to do and what God was going to do.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.160
And that was the real keystone of their power.

18:39.280 --> 18:39.960
Absolutely right.

18:39.960 --> 18:50.480
As it is of most priesthoods, the priesthoods maintain their power because you, as an ordinary person, can't communicate with the gods without their presence.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.960
And Caesar actually is quite specific about this.

18:54.020 --> 18:59.860
He says that they can prevent you from communicating with the gods.

19:00.060 --> 19:02.380
In other words, excommunicate you.

19:02.780 --> 19:06.640
And no one will speak to you and you'll just fall apart and have to go away.

19:06.640 --> 19:12.920
So they have immense power because they are the only way that you can contact the gods.

19:13.760 --> 19:19.480
So you say we don't know much about their beliefs, but Christians began to claim that they, in some ways, prefigured Christianity.

19:20.540 --> 19:21.680
Was that much later?

19:22.280 --> 19:26.860
Yes, that comes later when people are trying to bring these two things together.

19:27.580 --> 19:31.400
But we see them as the intermediaries.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.720
There is one famous bit of ritual.

19:33.720 --> 19:40.200
In fact, it's the only decent bit of ritual we've got, which Pliny talks about, which is the famous cutting of the mistletoe with a golden sickle.

19:40.920 --> 19:48.120
And he explains this in quite a lot of detail, how you have to have the right time of the moon.

19:48.260 --> 19:49.700
The moon mustn't be too strong.

19:49.840 --> 19:50.780
It mustn't be too weak.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.040
So you choose your time.

19:52.400 --> 20:02.100
And that's one of the other aspects of the Druids' control, that they controlled our knowledge of time, when is an appropriate time to do things, when isn't an appropriate time to do things.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.440
Very powerful, that is.

20:04.240 --> 20:08.620
And then you had to dress in, the priest had to dress in white robes.

20:09.620 --> 20:13.080
The mistletoe growing on the oak was particularly powerful.

20:13.660 --> 20:15.940
And you cut it with a golden sickle.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.300
It fell on a white cloth.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.740
You sacrificed white oxen and so on.

20:19.920 --> 20:24.360
So you get a sense of the complexity of belief and ritual there.

20:24.360 --> 20:24.940
Why mistletoe?

20:26.580 --> 20:32.880
I don't know what the particular power of mistletoe is, but the power of their belief in it was obviously very strong.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.520
They said it was all curing.

20:34.920 --> 20:43.860
But they also, and the same bit of Pliny, shows how very important their knowledge of plant law was and healing and the science of plants.

20:44.380 --> 20:46.560
So we just get that little glimpse from Pliny.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.380
Miranda, I'll just screen.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.880
What was the, let's talk about the Druids now and the occupying Roman power.

20:53.100 --> 20:53.900
In come the Romans.

20:55.000 --> 20:55.920
There are the Druids.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.460
There's a clash.

20:58.320 --> 21:08.840
As you said earlier in your opening remarks, the Roman commentators change tone markedly once the Romans get into this country and decide they're going to make it part of the Roman Empire.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.280
Can you talk about that, please?

21:11.280 --> 21:32.200
Yes, I mean, there's an interesting episode, particularly in AD 60, which is rather a key year for Romano-British history, partly because of the rebellion of Boudicca, but also because it's the time when the Roman governor, Suetonius Paulinus, who was brought in by Nero particularly to, as a conquistador, as it were.

21:33.260 --> 21:37.040
And Paulinus has decided that it's time to smash the Druids.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.760
And the Druids have their Holy of Holies on the island of Anglesey.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.420
Why is that?

21:43.000 --> 21:47.160
Because Anglesey is on the edge of the known world.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.440
Anglesey is an island.

21:48.780 --> 21:51.840
Islands can be very sacred in antiquity.

21:52.420 --> 21:56.820
And it was clearly, for some reason, considered there was a very holy grove there.

21:57.180 --> 22:01.740
And that's where, when the Druids were sort of against the wall, as it were, they retreated.

22:02.240 --> 22:07.000
Suetonius Paulinus took most of his legions and his auxiliaries all the way up to Anglesey.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.100
How many people would that be?

22:08.100 --> 22:14.480
Oh, we're talking about, I would say, about at least 20,000 people.

22:14.720 --> 22:18.080
So he'd marched them up to Anglesey, 20,000 fully armed Roman soldiers.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.380
Marched them up to Anglesey.

22:19.740 --> 22:22.260
But the Druids weren't allowed to do military training.

22:22.420 --> 22:26.440
So were they an unarmed bunch of people in Anglesey waiting to be slaughtered?

22:26.440 --> 22:29.080
Well, it wasn't that they were not allowed.

22:29.620 --> 22:31.740
They were exempt from military service.

22:32.320 --> 22:39.720
But we also hear from Caesar, a rather pretty story, really, where if you wanted to be archdruid, you could actually fight your corner.

22:39.860 --> 22:42.160
So they obviously weren't averse to the odd bit of sword play.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.380
What do you mean, fight your corner?

22:43.480 --> 22:44.180
Challenge the...

22:44.180 --> 22:44.440
Challenge.

22:44.600 --> 22:48.480
If you wanted to be archdruid, if you wanted to challenge the leadership, you might actually fight it out.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.460
With a sword or whatever?

22:49.460 --> 22:51.640
Yeah, which is a very pretty thought, in your long right robes.

22:52.380 --> 23:01.160
But to go back to Anglesey, we know that our greatest source for this is Tacitus, who talks in quite some detail about the conquest of Anglesey.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.840
And he talks about the Romans making flat-bottomed boats.

23:03.940 --> 23:07.000
They get up the Medina Straits and land actually on Anglesey.

23:07.000 --> 23:20.880
And they are met there by warriors and druids and sort of fanatical fury-like women, brandishing torches, and the druids are cursing.

23:21.100 --> 23:24.160
And their weaponry is words.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.080
We're going back again to the oral tradition.

23:26.600 --> 23:33.320
Words, word power, satire, the ability of words and curses to turn something against the enemy.

23:33.320 --> 23:40.740
Now, we have to remember that we always have this business that, you know, Gaul and Britain are very superstitious, rather barbaric and rather primitive and so on.

23:41.260 --> 23:43.620
The Romans were unbelievably superstitious.

23:44.080 --> 23:52.340
And the sight of these druids screaming imprecations at the soldiers trying to land would have been incredible psychological warfare.

23:53.560 --> 24:03.300
So you have this picture of this sort of dense, armed mass of people and people armed with words and people armed with swords fighting to keep their groves safe.

24:03.320 --> 24:08.560
And bottling up 20,000 Roman soldiers in the process.

24:10.080 --> 24:14.900
But the Romans, from what I read, just slaughtered most of them.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.380
They did, but they were interrupted.

24:17.780 --> 24:20.800
It's not quite clear whether they actually managed the entire job.

24:21.440 --> 24:27.940
Because while this is going on, Paulinus gets word that Boudicca is busy raising Roman towns to the ground.

24:27.940 --> 24:37.480
Is there any connection, as I've read in the notes of somebody, one of you, that actually the druids wanted Boudicca to do that, to divert attention from Anglesey?

24:37.780 --> 24:40.320
I think it was quite cleverly orchestrated.

24:40.860 --> 24:43.840
I am quite sure that the druids were involved in this.

24:44.780 --> 24:50.220
There is even a possibility, it's remote, that Boudicca herself might have been a druid.

24:50.320 --> 24:55.880
Because we know that she was herself involved in divination, in sort of sacred groves in London.

24:55.880 --> 25:05.680
And I think it was highly orchestrated, surely a coincidence, that Paulinus is up in the north-west and something happens in the south-east.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.780
I didn't realise he'd taken so many troops.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.620
That's a lot, isn't it?

25:08.740 --> 25:09.360
It is a lot.

25:09.360 --> 25:20.680
And one interesting thing, again, as Barry said, all this business about trying to get some archaeological evidence together with the written sources is so difficult.

25:21.040 --> 25:33.700
But there's one theory I have, which I really like to posit here, and that is that on the way up to Anglesey, the Roman soldiers would have had to pass a place very close to Lindo Moss,

25:33.700 --> 25:42.260
which is where Lindo Mann, a sacrificed young man, probably around that time, was found in 1984.

25:42.760 --> 25:49.160
And I just wonder whether that was an aversion sacrifice to try and avert that disaster that was about to happen on Anglesey.

25:49.640 --> 25:55.260
Justin Champion, why did the druids went into fairly steep decline, rather quickly?

25:55.820 --> 25:57.260
Can you tell us why?

25:57.260 --> 26:04.400
I mean, I'm pretty sure it's the result of Romanisation in both a military sense, but also in a legal sense,

26:04.520 --> 26:10.900
because certainly at some point by the 60s AD, you can't be a Roman citizen and a druid,

26:11.000 --> 26:17.440
so you're narrowing down the opportunities for learned men to go into the sort of business, if you like.

26:17.560 --> 26:21.320
But after Mona, after the destruction at Anglesey...

26:21.320 --> 26:22.220
Anglesey called Mona.

26:22.220 --> 26:29.460
It's quite clear that Druidism is trying to be destroyed in all sorts of cultural ways,

26:29.500 --> 26:37.280
and we don't really know that much into the early Anglo-Saxon period about what happens to them, I think.

26:37.280 --> 26:44.340
But one can imagine, combined with Romanisation, the introduction of Christianity,

26:44.340 --> 26:53.080
even if we believe some of the 17th century accounts, even this early, is a rival tradition.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.900
I just wondered if we could perhaps add a little bit to that,

26:58.000 --> 27:01.860
because there are later Roman writers who talk about Druids,

27:02.060 --> 27:07.180
and that in itself is interesting because it means that the Druids remain in the Roman consciousness

27:07.180 --> 27:09.020
right to the 4th century AD.

27:09.020 --> 27:12.660
We have a poet called Osonius, a Bordeaux poet,

27:13.100 --> 27:18.000
who wrote a very long treatise about his fellow rhetoricians at the University of Bordeaux,

27:18.260 --> 27:22.860
and he talks about Druids, and by then he's talking of Druids being dynastic,

27:23.480 --> 27:27.540
and the mantle of Druidism falling from father to son.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.140
He actually mentions a number of people in this dynasty.

27:30.300 --> 27:34.040
Now, whether or not these are the same kind of Druids that we would have found in Caesar,

27:34.320 --> 27:35.240
I'm sure they weren't.

27:35.240 --> 27:40.300
But the other interesting thing is a funny lot of documents called the Augustan Histories.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.360
These date the sort of 3rd and 4th centuries AD,

27:43.960 --> 27:50.200
and there are three or four stories about the accession to the purple of emperors like Aurelian,

27:50.360 --> 27:52.220
Numerian and Diocletian,

27:52.840 --> 27:56.540
and that is predicted by Gaulish Druidesses.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.580
So what's interesting for me about that is that,

28:00.900 --> 28:02.600
however much that may have been nonsense,

28:02.600 --> 28:05.160
it means that Druids are still in the consciousness.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.680
Barry Cunliffe,

28:07.960 --> 28:11.160
although I've used the word exterminated,

28:11.380 --> 28:12.280
as I've picked up properly,

28:12.720 --> 28:14.720
that's not right, really.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.020
They didn't disappear entirely,

28:16.220 --> 28:18.600
and they're still continued in Ireland,

28:19.420 --> 28:20.660
unconquered by the Romans.

28:20.780 --> 28:23.760
Can you give us some idea how they drifted,

28:23.840 --> 28:24.620
and this is ridiculous,

28:24.760 --> 28:28.020
but for the next, well, say, 1,000 years,

28:28.120 --> 28:29.980
after the 3rd, 4th century AD?

28:29.980 --> 28:32.440
Yes, as you say,

28:32.500 --> 28:34.060
they continued in Ireland for a while,

28:34.200 --> 28:39.540
but were gradually turned into insignificance by the rise of Christianity.

28:39.920 --> 28:43.480
But there were the Bards going on.

28:43.540 --> 28:44.500
This Bardic tradition,

28:44.660 --> 28:45.660
this oral tradition,

28:45.660 --> 28:49.000
was an element of Druidism,

28:49.220 --> 28:52.000
which continued into Irish society,

28:52.120 --> 28:54.460
as indeed it did in Welsh society.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.920
So if you're looking for any real thread of continuity,

28:58.240 --> 29:00.440
the Bardic tradition in those two societies

29:00.440 --> 29:02.620
is as good a thread as you can find,

29:02.760 --> 29:04.460
but the religious overlay

29:04.460 --> 29:07.620
has completely been wiped out by Christianity.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.560
How reliable do you take the Bardic tradition?

29:10.760 --> 29:12.800
Is it reinvented every 50 years,

29:12.880 --> 29:13.860
every two or three generations?

29:14.060 --> 29:15.380
Is there a real continuity?

29:15.880 --> 29:17.400
There is a continuity.

29:17.940 --> 29:19.240
Particularly in Wales,

29:19.580 --> 29:21.380
it had almost died out.

29:21.380 --> 29:22.220
At the Ice Stedfords,

29:22.640 --> 29:24.840
you're getting about six or seven turning up.

29:24.880 --> 29:25.060
When?

29:25.120 --> 29:25.720
What day do we talk about?

29:25.720 --> 29:28.920
We're talking about the 17th century.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.060
The 19th century.

29:30.280 --> 29:30.620
Oh, yes.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.040
In the 18th century,

29:32.220 --> 29:33.940
it begins to take off again

29:33.940 --> 29:35.620
with the whole Celtic revival,

29:35.800 --> 29:37.500
Celtomania.

29:37.780 --> 29:38.120
But still,

29:38.220 --> 29:39.420
we've missed out.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.640
Have you got anything to get hold of

29:42.640 --> 29:45.760
between about 400 AD and the 16th century?

29:46.240 --> 29:46.960
Virtually nothing.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.900
So what you're saying is

29:48.900 --> 29:50.660
when it starts again in the 16th century,

29:51.260 --> 29:53.860
they are making it up

29:53.860 --> 29:55.860
as much as taking it for,

29:56.040 --> 29:57.360
as much as inheriting it.

29:57.680 --> 29:58.000
Yes.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.300
From the 16th century onwards,

29:59.500 --> 30:02.660
people are looking at the classical texts

30:02.660 --> 30:05.060
and they are reinventing

30:05.060 --> 30:07.220
a sort of romantic view of Druidism.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.600
And you've only got these little threads

30:09.600 --> 30:11.480
of things like the Ice Stedford,

30:11.600 --> 30:13.860
like the storytellers,

30:13.860 --> 30:16.420
which are a very pale reflection

30:16.420 --> 30:17.320
of what went before.

30:17.960 --> 30:18.600
Justin Champion,

30:19.400 --> 30:20.660
John Aubrey in the 17th century

30:20.660 --> 30:22.100
became interested in the Druids.

30:22.260 --> 30:23.640
We know him from brief lives,

30:24.060 --> 30:25.420
but he was an antiquarian

30:25.420 --> 30:27.040
and some sort of archaeologist.

30:27.340 --> 30:28.700
And the interest began,

30:28.820 --> 30:30.000
which has never ceased really,

30:30.060 --> 30:31.480
and he was one of the early,

30:31.700 --> 30:32.660
let's call it modern,

30:33.160 --> 30:36.420
persons to revive it.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.180
Can you tell us about,

30:38.520 --> 30:39.360
can you tell us what he did?

30:40.200 --> 30:41.480
Aubrey in one sense

30:41.480 --> 30:44.380
is a great under-explored scholar

30:44.380 --> 30:46.060
and man of learning.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.860
And he represents the sort of legacy

30:48.860 --> 30:49.940
of Renaissance humanism.

30:50.020 --> 30:50.900
As Barry's just said,

30:51.160 --> 30:53.060
all of these classical texts,

30:53.160 --> 30:54.560
whether it's Historia Augusta

30:54.560 --> 30:56.100
or Pliny or Tacitus,

30:56.260 --> 30:58.360
are rediscovered in the 16th century.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.380
And nationalist scholars,

31:01.560 --> 31:02.360
whether they're in France

31:02.360 --> 31:03.740
or in England or in Ireland,

31:04.260 --> 31:05.480
want to make a connection

31:05.480 --> 31:08.540
with those sets of primary documents

31:08.540 --> 31:09.420
and connect them

31:09.420 --> 31:10.920
to their own particular communities.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.520
So we'll get defences

31:12.520 --> 31:13.620
of French Druidry,

31:14.000 --> 31:14.880
English Druidry,

31:15.100 --> 31:16.320
as texture things.

31:16.820 --> 31:18.100
The step that Aubrey takes

31:18.100 --> 31:19.700
is he goes out into the landscape,

31:19.860 --> 31:20.960
to the ruins in the landscape.

31:21.220 --> 31:23.760
He's perhaps the first field archaeologist.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.080
And drawing from hints

31:26.080 --> 31:28.380
from people like Inigo Jones,

31:28.500 --> 31:29.860
who had studied Stonehenge

31:29.860 --> 31:31.260
and was pretty much convinced

31:31.260 --> 31:33.240
it was a Roman temple of some sort,

31:33.240 --> 31:36.420
and reading sort of Danish scholarship

31:36.420 --> 31:38.060
that say, no, no, Stonehenge

31:38.060 --> 31:40.640
is a relic of a Danish conquest.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.520
Aubrey goes out and measures,

31:43.740 --> 31:44.620
draws, maps,

31:44.900 --> 31:46.820
both Stonehenge and Avebury,

31:47.040 --> 31:48.880
and then a whole series of other relics,

31:49.340 --> 31:52.360
and makes the sort of intellectual leap

31:52.360 --> 31:55.820
to connect those early sort of textual sources

31:55.820 --> 31:57.580
with these real artefacts.

31:57.660 --> 31:59.540
And I think from that moment on,

31:59.860 --> 32:00.960
we can see the invention

32:00.960 --> 32:04.240
of a whole series of Druidical practices.

32:04.740 --> 32:06.820
And it's even more brilliant in one sense

32:06.820 --> 32:09.240
that Aubrey is a great draftsman.

32:09.660 --> 32:12.280
He commissions other representations.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.000
And the drawings of Stonehenge

32:15.000 --> 32:17.940
suddenly have little Druidical figures popping up

32:17.940 --> 32:21.180
that he's lifted from another imaginative source.

32:21.660 --> 32:23.900
And those representations persist.

32:24.340 --> 32:25.160
I mean, they're reproduced

32:25.160 --> 32:26.240
in many, many books today,

32:26.320 --> 32:29.140
but they persist as ways of thinking imaginatively

32:29.140 --> 32:30.480
about what Druids were.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.420
Miranda, let's turn to Stonehenge

32:33.420 --> 32:35.120
and William Stukeley

32:35.120 --> 32:37.420
and the association that was there

32:37.420 --> 32:38.160
for quite a while,

32:38.400 --> 32:40.940
that Stonehenge was built by,

32:41.020 --> 32:44.820
part of the Druids' tradition and religion.

32:45.600 --> 32:45.760
Yes.

32:45.980 --> 32:47.740
Can you tell this is about Stukeley?

32:47.880 --> 32:49.700
Because Stukeley, as it were,

32:49.740 --> 32:50.780
takes us on from Aubrey.

32:51.160 --> 32:51.800
Stukeley does.

32:51.920 --> 32:52.800
Stukeley's very interesting

32:52.800 --> 32:55.260
because he's born in 1687.

32:55.260 --> 32:57.680
He takes holy orders in 1729

32:57.680 --> 33:01.520
and he becomes a clergyman

33:01.520 --> 33:04.260
who then brings together his two great interests

33:04.260 --> 33:08.100
in ancient religion and archaeology

33:08.100 --> 33:09.740
and megaliths particularly.

33:09.740 --> 33:13.160
And I think when we're thinking about Aubrey

33:13.160 --> 33:14.620
and Stukeley and their fellows,

33:15.040 --> 33:18.840
we have to remember that it's only comparatively recently

33:18.840 --> 33:21.480
that we managed to get a long timeline

33:21.480 --> 33:23.260
back into the remote past for Britain.

33:23.780 --> 33:27.020
Before then, there was no means of, you know,

33:27.060 --> 33:28.580
talking about a deep past,

33:28.820 --> 33:30.180
a deep human past for Britain.

33:30.180 --> 33:32.840
So Stukeley, like Aubrey,

33:32.960 --> 33:36.500
saw Stonehenge as a pre-Roman temple.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.660
The Druids were pre-Roman priests.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.380
Therefore, Stonehenge must be associated with the Druids.

33:42.740 --> 33:44.540
But Stukeley goes one step further.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
He goes a bit strange after a while.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.920
His sermons get more and more Druidic

33:50.920 --> 33:55.960
and he finds an alleged inscription from Dijon

33:55.960 --> 33:58.760
which talks about a Druid called Chindernax.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.500
And Chindernax was a name that Stukeley adopted

34:02.500 --> 34:04.460
and he began to sign his letters,

34:05.280 --> 34:08.100
Your Sincerely Chindernax Druid.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.080
So he didn't find any problem

34:11.080 --> 34:13.980
with being clergymen and Church of England

34:13.980 --> 34:14.820
at the same time.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.740
No, no.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.740
And I think that could have been partly,

34:18.060 --> 34:19.220
if we can go back a little bit,

34:19.260 --> 34:19.920
if you wouldn't mind,

34:20.380 --> 34:22.580
to early Ireland and the interface

34:22.580 --> 34:23.880
between paganism and Christianity.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.420
We have wonderful documents

34:26.420 --> 34:28.440
such as the 7th century lives of Bridget

34:28.440 --> 34:29.140
and Patrick.

34:29.720 --> 34:31.580
And Bridget is a particularly interesting one

34:31.580 --> 34:33.840
because she grows up in a Druid's household

34:33.840 --> 34:35.820
and he becomes Christianised

34:35.820 --> 34:36.840
but remains a Druid.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.860
And there doesn't seem to be a tension

34:38.860 --> 34:41.180
between Christians and Druids.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.180
I think your account of Stukeley is wonderful

34:44.180 --> 34:46.280
and we need to sort of really emphasise

34:46.280 --> 34:48.580
that he is doing Trinitarian archaeology.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.560
Stukeley, in one sense,

34:50.640 --> 34:52.040
subscribes to Usher's view

34:52.040 --> 34:54.560
that the world is only about 6,000 years old.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.480
So you've got to fit all of these things

34:56.480 --> 34:59.300
from Adam to Moses to the Druids to now

34:59.300 --> 35:00.780
into that chronology.

35:01.340 --> 35:03.580
And he's reacting very, very much

35:03.580 --> 35:05.760
against some of the deistical accounts

35:05.760 --> 35:07.800
of the Druids as wicked pagan priests.

35:08.220 --> 35:11.700
So Druidism is a form of patriarchal,

35:11.760 --> 35:12.840
Abramic worship.

35:13.380 --> 35:15.000
And it's not just Stukeley.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.200
People like Isaac Newton,

35:16.580 --> 35:18.420
supposed modern rationalists,

35:18.760 --> 35:21.160
see Stonehenge as the remnants

35:21.160 --> 35:23.140
of sort of ancient fire worship

35:23.140 --> 35:24.940
that is only then contaminated

35:24.940 --> 35:26.260
by corrupt Christianity.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.100
Barrick, on Stonehenge,

35:28.220 --> 35:30.560
it's been discredited that the Druids

35:30.560 --> 35:31.900
could possibly have built Stonehenge.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.440
It was built, hasn't it?

35:33.620 --> 35:33.800
No.

35:34.140 --> 35:34.940
Oh, I thought it was.

35:34.940 --> 35:35.180
No, no.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.460
Well, one of you told me that.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.300
No, well, I think...

35:37.300 --> 35:38.380
Who is a guilty contributor?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.780
Yeah, there's some new ideas here

35:40.780 --> 35:41.680
we've got to explore, I think.

35:41.960 --> 35:46.360
The idea that Druids are to be related

35:46.360 --> 35:48.240
with Latane culture, I think,

35:48.980 --> 35:52.100
is an idea of the 50s and 60s

35:52.100 --> 35:52.800
of the last century,

35:52.920 --> 35:54.900
and most archaeologists have thrown that out.

35:56.100 --> 35:58.100
If we try and find out...

35:58.100 --> 36:00.280
If we look at the development

36:00.280 --> 36:01.840
of religious structures

36:01.840 --> 36:04.500
and behaviour in Britain

36:04.500 --> 36:07.340
and look at what was happening

36:07.340 --> 36:08.840
in the first century BC

36:08.840 --> 36:10.000
when there were Druids

36:10.000 --> 36:12.740
and then try and back-project

36:12.740 --> 36:14.760
those behaviour patterns,

36:14.760 --> 36:16.760
we can see that some elements

36:16.760 --> 36:19.420
of the belief systems of the Druids,

36:19.800 --> 36:21.320
cosmology, for example,

36:21.400 --> 36:22.620
can be dated right back

36:22.620 --> 36:25.040
to at least 3000 BC in Britain.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.020
Some of the practices

36:27.020 --> 36:28.740
of digging deep shafts

36:28.740 --> 36:30.800
and putting offerings in them,

36:30.860 --> 36:31.880
again, can go back

36:31.880 --> 36:33.720
to the 3rd or 2nd millennium.

36:34.180 --> 36:36.140
So I think there is a good case

36:36.140 --> 36:37.000
to be made out

36:37.000 --> 36:39.400
for the belief systems

36:39.400 --> 36:41.300
of the Druids

36:41.300 --> 36:44.420
from the 4th or 3rd centuries BC

36:44.420 --> 36:45.940
are deeply rooted

36:45.940 --> 36:47.280
in the belief systems

36:47.280 --> 36:48.200
of the area

36:48.200 --> 36:49.320
that go right back

36:49.320 --> 36:50.440
into the Neolithic period.

36:50.740 --> 36:51.420
But Stonehenge

36:51.420 --> 36:52.280
is so emblematic.

36:52.780 --> 36:53.520
Can you just...

36:53.520 --> 36:54.280
You said...

36:54.280 --> 36:55.160
Yes, they might...

36:55.160 --> 36:56.060
Look, I'm...

36:56.060 --> 36:58.140
There's a revolution

36:58.140 --> 36:58.840
going on in my head.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.360
I came here all prepared to put...

37:00.360 --> 37:00.620
All right.

37:00.740 --> 37:01.700
You say that they could have

37:01.700 --> 37:02.700
had a hand in building it.

37:02.960 --> 37:03.720
Or they could have built it.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.220
Could be that.

37:04.380 --> 37:05.200
No, no, not quite.

37:05.300 --> 37:05.820
You're putting words

37:05.820 --> 37:06.420
in my mouth here.

37:07.180 --> 37:08.060
No, what I'm saying

37:08.060 --> 37:11.500
is that the religious beliefs

37:11.500 --> 37:14.800
which later are practiced

37:14.800 --> 37:15.740
by the Druids

37:15.740 --> 37:18.080
might be very deep-rooted

37:18.080 --> 37:18.560
in Britain

37:18.560 --> 37:19.760
and might be reflected

37:19.760 --> 37:21.620
in buildings like Stonehenge.

37:21.620 --> 37:23.580
Now, whether they were

37:23.580 --> 37:25.140
calling themselves Druids

37:25.140 --> 37:26.700
at that time,

37:26.900 --> 37:27.720
who knows?

37:28.260 --> 37:29.880
But we've got to look

37:29.880 --> 37:30.460
for the roots

37:30.460 --> 37:31.940
of these belief systems

37:31.940 --> 37:33.300
and the roots go back in time.

37:33.580 --> 37:34.840
Would it be fair to say, then,

37:34.840 --> 37:39.080
that the Druids adopted Stonehenge

37:39.080 --> 37:40.960
and for...

37:40.960 --> 37:41.800
You're shaking your head again.

37:42.220 --> 37:42.440
No.

37:43.400 --> 37:44.120
Strangely enough,

37:44.180 --> 37:45.560
there's no real evidence,

37:46.020 --> 37:47.360
very little evidence...

37:47.360 --> 37:48.080
Well, when did the...

37:48.080 --> 37:50.040
We now think of Stonehenge

37:50.040 --> 37:50.920
and the Druids together.

37:51.120 --> 37:51.240
OK.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.000
Well, let's get to...

37:52.000 --> 37:53.360
Let me get to the hinge of it.

37:53.480 --> 37:53.600
OK.

37:53.640 --> 37:54.440
When did that happen?

37:55.860 --> 37:56.340
Right.

37:58.340 --> 37:59.760
People like Aubrey,

38:00.280 --> 38:01.740
people like Stukley

38:01.740 --> 38:04.180
came up with the idea

38:04.180 --> 38:05.940
that Stonehenge

38:05.940 --> 38:06.500
and Avebury

38:06.500 --> 38:07.540
were the temples

38:07.540 --> 38:08.280
of the Druids.

38:08.780 --> 38:09.880
And that idea

38:09.880 --> 38:11.320
has pervaded

38:11.320 --> 38:14.020
scholarly and less scholarly

38:14.020 --> 38:15.760
thought since then.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.960
Now, what I'm saying...

38:17.960 --> 38:19.140
Archaeologists have come in

38:19.140 --> 38:19.540
and said,

38:19.760 --> 38:20.440
absolute rubbish,

38:20.620 --> 38:21.200
there are only Druids

38:21.200 --> 38:22.240
from the 4th century BC.

38:22.660 --> 38:23.560
Stonehenge is a lot earlier

38:23.560 --> 38:23.920
than that,

38:23.980 --> 38:24.580
so it can't be.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.160
What I'm saying

38:26.160 --> 38:26.840
with a number

38:26.840 --> 38:27.580
of other archaeologists

38:27.580 --> 38:28.840
is that the roots

38:28.840 --> 38:29.660
go back deeper

38:29.660 --> 38:31.980
and it's not impossible

38:31.980 --> 38:33.660
that rituals

38:33.660 --> 38:34.660
similar to those

38:34.660 --> 38:35.920
of the Druidic rituals

38:35.920 --> 38:37.000
were associated

38:37.000 --> 38:38.660
with the building

38:38.660 --> 38:40.040
and the early use

38:40.040 --> 38:40.660
of Stonehenge.

38:41.260 --> 38:42.320
I think, Barry,

38:42.360 --> 38:42.860
that's why

38:42.860 --> 38:44.400
the other figure

38:44.400 --> 38:45.460
we could talk about,

38:45.520 --> 38:46.200
John Toland,

38:46.420 --> 38:47.760
is so interesting

38:47.760 --> 38:48.780
because although

38:48.780 --> 38:50.820
his critical history

38:50.820 --> 38:51.540
of the Druids

38:51.540 --> 38:52.260
and a specimen

38:52.260 --> 38:53.200
of Celtic learning

38:53.200 --> 38:54.200
is probably,

38:54.800 --> 38:56.180
at the end of the day,

38:56.300 --> 38:57.000
nothing more

38:57.000 --> 38:57.500
than a very,

38:57.600 --> 38:58.720
very elaborate joke

38:58.720 --> 38:59.980
but a very

38:59.980 --> 39:01.720
extraordinarily learned one,

39:02.640 --> 39:03.920
he represents

39:03.920 --> 39:05.800
some sort of early

39:05.800 --> 39:07.260
pre-Egyptian,

39:07.500 --> 39:09.340
pre-Pythagorean Druidism

39:09.340 --> 39:10.640
taking place

39:10.640 --> 39:11.740
not just in Ireland,

39:11.900 --> 39:12.700
not just in Wales,

39:12.800 --> 39:13.760
but certainly in Scotland

39:13.760 --> 39:15.320
and he confects

39:15.320 --> 39:17.020
this entire sort of

39:17.020 --> 39:18.800
early Druid republic

39:18.800 --> 39:19.440
where everything

39:19.440 --> 39:20.180
is godly

39:20.180 --> 39:21.620
and virtuous.

39:22.860 --> 39:23.440
We've missed

39:23.440 --> 39:24.280
our human sacrifice

39:24.280 --> 39:24.900
and we haven't got

39:24.900 --> 39:25.300
much time.

39:25.380 --> 39:26.140
We've got to turn to it

39:26.140 --> 39:26.740
because it's part

39:26.740 --> 39:27.300
of the story.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.040
They were accused of,

39:29.080 --> 39:29.260
well,

39:29.440 --> 39:29.960
there's been human

39:29.960 --> 39:30.900
sacrifice in so many

39:30.900 --> 39:31.700
religions and they

39:31.700 --> 39:32.140
continue.

39:33.700 --> 39:34.180
Can you,

39:34.380 --> 39:35.660
and it was thought

39:35.660 --> 39:36.860
by some early writers

39:36.860 --> 39:37.960
and some early commentators,

39:38.040 --> 39:39.040
was this black propaganda

39:39.040 --> 39:39.560
that Miranda

39:39.560 --> 39:40.280
you're going to tell us,

39:40.600 --> 39:41.880
as being excessive,

39:42.120 --> 39:43.540
that altars ran with blood,

39:43.740 --> 39:44.620
that sort of thing.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.000
What about human sacrifice

39:46.000 --> 39:46.620
and the Druids?

39:46.660 --> 39:47.180
What do we know?

39:48.540 --> 39:49.780
I think it's fair to say

39:49.780 --> 39:50.700
that human sacrifice

39:50.700 --> 39:51.960
probably did take place.

39:52.100 --> 39:52.480
There is some

39:52.480 --> 39:53.200
archaeological evidence

39:53.200 --> 39:53.780
for it,

39:53.920 --> 39:54.320
for example,

39:54.380 --> 39:55.060
in the bog bodies

39:55.060 --> 39:56.420
places like Lindo Moss

39:56.420 --> 39:57.300
that I've mentioned before

39:57.300 --> 39:58.340
and quite a lot

39:58.340 --> 39:59.240
of other evidence

39:59.240 --> 40:00.700
but the archaeological

40:00.700 --> 40:01.940
evidence suggests

40:01.940 --> 40:03.060
that it was happening

40:03.060 --> 40:04.060
but it was rare

40:04.060 --> 40:05.340
and it would only happen

40:05.340 --> 40:06.440
at times of great crisis

40:06.440 --> 40:07.860
and I think what's happened

40:07.860 --> 40:09.620
is that when Caesar

40:09.620 --> 40:10.340
talks about it,

40:10.400 --> 40:11.060
he talks about it

40:11.060 --> 40:12.220
in a very matter-of-fact way.

40:12.860 --> 40:15.240
He says it is,

40:15.600 --> 40:16.300
the Druids find it

40:16.300 --> 40:18.060
appropriate to sacrifice

40:18.780 --> 40:19.700
human beings

40:19.700 --> 40:22.120
for efficacious purposes.

40:22.680 --> 40:23.460
They would try and use

40:23.460 --> 40:24.140
prisoners of war

40:24.140 --> 40:24.600
or criminals

40:24.600 --> 40:25.280
but if there weren't

40:25.280 --> 40:25.580
enough

40:25.580 --> 40:26.520
then the innocents

40:26.520 --> 40:27.320
would make up

40:27.320 --> 40:27.740
the numbers.

40:28.480 --> 40:29.060
He's very pragmatic

40:29.060 --> 40:29.640
about this.

40:29.860 --> 40:30.540
We have to remember

40:30.540 --> 40:31.860
that human sacrifice

40:31.860 --> 40:33.440
was only outlawed

40:33.440 --> 40:34.700
in Rome in 97 BC,

40:34.880 --> 40:35.860
not that long ago

40:35.860 --> 40:36.960
before Caesar.

40:37.660 --> 40:38.620
The other writers

40:38.620 --> 40:39.240
like Pliny,

40:39.400 --> 40:39.920
like Tacitus,

40:40.060 --> 40:40.580
like Lucan,

40:40.820 --> 40:41.660
they do sort of

40:41.660 --> 40:43.580
talk it up a bit.

40:43.700 --> 40:44.460
They do talk about

40:44.460 --> 40:45.460
altars running with blood

40:45.460 --> 40:47.360
but I think human sacrifice

40:47.360 --> 40:48.300
did take place

40:48.300 --> 40:49.080
but it was not

40:49.080 --> 40:50.660
that out of the ordinary.

40:50.820 --> 40:51.240
It was not

40:51.240 --> 40:52.980
that big a deal.

40:52.980 --> 40:53.580
Barry?

40:53.940 --> 40:54.340
Barry Conner?

40:54.520 --> 40:54.760
Yes,

40:54.900 --> 40:56.140
there is evidence

40:56.140 --> 40:58.400
in Iron Age archaeology

40:58.400 --> 41:00.440
that bodies,

41:00.700 --> 41:02.200
people were sacrificed

41:02.200 --> 41:02.640
I think.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.720
I excavated some pits

41:04.720 --> 41:05.540
in a hill fort

41:05.540 --> 41:06.180
called Dainbury

41:06.180 --> 41:08.560
where there are bodies

41:08.560 --> 41:10.380
thrown into the bottoms

41:10.380 --> 41:10.960
of pits

41:10.960 --> 41:11.940
with stones

41:11.940 --> 41:12.980
heaped down on them.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.080
Now that doesn't look

41:14.080 --> 41:15.040
very much like

41:15.040 --> 41:16.260
normal burial practice

41:16.260 --> 41:18.240
so there are hints

41:18.240 --> 41:18.760
like that

41:18.760 --> 41:19.840
in the archaeological evidence

41:19.840 --> 41:20.840
and indeed

41:20.840 --> 41:21.560
the bog bodies

41:21.560 --> 41:22.660
but I think Miranda

41:22.660 --> 41:23.740
is absolutely right

41:23.740 --> 41:25.620
that this was an extreme.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.220
This was what you did

41:27.220 --> 41:28.440
when things were going

41:28.440 --> 41:29.760
really got bad

41:29.760 --> 41:31.300
and you had to placate

41:31.300 --> 41:31.780
the gods

41:31.780 --> 41:33.280
rather like the Carthaginians

41:33.280 --> 41:34.860
sacrificing their kids

41:34.860 --> 41:36.000
when things went bad.

41:36.800 --> 41:37.720
I think one of the

41:37.720 --> 41:38.460
interesting things

41:38.460 --> 41:39.360
is that the 18th

41:39.360 --> 41:40.120
and 19th century

41:40.120 --> 41:41.420
aren't really interested

41:41.420 --> 41:42.760
in Druids as sacrifices.

41:42.980 --> 41:43.500
They're interested

41:43.500 --> 41:45.320
in Druids as recoverers

41:45.320 --> 41:45.940
of some sort of

41:45.940 --> 41:46.760
natural spirit

41:46.760 --> 41:48.580
and the huge sort of effort

41:48.580 --> 41:49.900
into reconstructing

41:49.900 --> 41:50.640
Druidical temples

41:50.640 --> 41:51.380
and saving land

41:51.380 --> 41:52.300
Exactly

41:52.300 --> 41:53.500
so they're communing

41:53.500 --> 41:54.080
with nature

41:54.080 --> 41:55.200
they're the sort of

41:55.200 --> 41:56.280
early ecological

41:56.280 --> 41:57.020
sort of warriors

41:57.020 --> 41:57.600
in one sense.

41:57.620 --> 41:58.620
Yes they are very much so

41:58.620 --> 41:59.800
and these holy sites

41:59.800 --> 42:00.920
become preserved sites

42:00.920 --> 42:02.340
and the idea of preserving sites

42:02.340 --> 42:03.540
owes a lot to that.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.300
And even to the lengths

42:05.300 --> 42:06.700
of very wealthy aristocrats

42:06.700 --> 42:08.960
importing from Brittany

42:08.960 --> 42:09.540
and elsewhere

42:09.540 --> 42:10.540
sacred sites

42:10.540 --> 42:11.560
and reconstructing them

42:11.560 --> 42:12.940
in their own sort of land.

42:13.300 --> 42:14.060
Well thank you very much

Miranda Hodges Green

42:16.660 --> 42:17.900
next year we'll be talking

42:17.900 --> 42:19.900
about the ontological argument

42:19.900 --> 42:20.680
first outlined

42:20.680 --> 42:21.620
in the 7th century

42:21.620 --> 42:22.760
by Anselm

42:22.760 --> 42:23.760
the argument

42:23.760 --> 42:24.380
is an attempt

42:24.380 --> 42:25.300
to prove the existence

42:25.300 --> 42:25.820
of God

42:25.820 --> 42:26.840
through reason alone.

42:27.000 --> 42:27.580

42:42.080 --> 42:42.900
I've sounded like

42:42.900 --> 42:43.700
a broken record.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.460
I do not want kids.

42:45.600 --> 42:46.340
I do not ever want

42:46.340 --> 42:47.820
I don't want to have a kid

42:47.820 --> 42:48.500
don't want to have a kid

42:48.500 --> 42:49.200
don't want to have a kid

42:50.960 --> 42:52.520
the door is almost closed

42:52.520 --> 42:54.060
and suddenly

42:54.060 --> 42:55.420
I'm not so sure

42:55.420 --> 42:57.060
the story has

42:57.060 --> 42:58.280
always been no

42:58.280 --> 42:59.880
I'm just wondering

42:59.880 --> 43:01.080
to what degree

43:01.080 --> 43:02.300
it's just a story.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.100
Definitely just a story.
