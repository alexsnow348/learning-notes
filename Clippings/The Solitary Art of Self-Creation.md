## Questions to ask for yourself

> “The whole life of the individual is nothing but the process of giving birth to himself; indeed, we should be fully born when we die — although it is the tragic fate of most individuals to die before they are born.”

 — **Erich Fromm**
 
- Are you satisfied with who you are and what you’ve attained in life? 
- Can you look yourself in the mirror in the early hours of dawn and honestly answer that question?
- Have you carved out a life true to who you are beyond the job, the title, the possessions, and society's tedious obligations? 
- Have you ever accomplished anything on your own terms to be truly proud of?
- Have you achieved some aspect of personal excellence through the cultivation of your own creative powers? Or are you simply living out your life as a walking mimicry, relying on customs, fashions, false appearances, and the opinions of others to nourish your sense of self-worth?

## The Top Five Regrets of the Dying

1) “I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.”
2) “I wish I hadn't worked so hard.”
3) “I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.” 
4) “I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.” 
5) “I wish I had let myself be happier.”


To become the artist of your life is to forever seek the light and resist being marred by the endless mire of this batshit crazy world. 

It is to be inventive, daring, well-read, and untamed in your quest. Give attention to the hunger of your soul. Explore the full range of your own potentialities and suppressed passions.


**“the most common form of despair is not being who you are.”**

**“through blind acceptance of collective opinions, we cripple ourselves and our own potential for meaningful growth and change, and we rarely understand how closely such debilitation is linked with depression, physical illness, neurosis, and death.”**

Wake from the slumber of habit and do something no one has done before.

 “Find what you love and let it kill you. Let it drain you of your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness.”
 
**Any attempt to achieve inner greatness must be done alone.**


“Without effort and willingness to experience pain and anxiety, nobody grows, in fact nobody achieves anything worth achieving.”


“Any human being who does not wish to be part of the masses need only stop making things easy for himself. Let him follow his conscience, which calls out to him: ‘Be yourself! All that you are now doing, thinking, desiring, all that is not you.’”


“You are capable of more than you know. Choose a goal that seems right for you and strive to be the best, however hard the path. Aim high. Behave honorably. Prepare to be alone at times, and to endure failure. Persist! The world needs all you can give.”


“No one can build you the bridge on which you, and only you, must cross the river of life. There may be countless trails and bridges and demigods who would gladly carry you across; but only at the price of pawning and forgoing yourself. There is one path in the world that none can walk but you. Where does it lead? Don’t ask, walk!”
