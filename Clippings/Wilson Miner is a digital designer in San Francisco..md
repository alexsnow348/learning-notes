I’m particularly interested in design systems, code as a design tool, and how we shape our world through design.

I’m currently a product designer at [Apple](https://apple.com/). Recently, I worked on a product design system at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and helped [The California Sunday Magazine](https://californiasunday.com/) bring ambitious storytelling and photography together online.

As a product designer at [Facebook](https://facebook.com/), I helped create a unified system of interface design guidelines. I led the design team at [Rdio](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio), and I co-founded [EveryBlock](https://everyblock.com/), an influential civic journalism startup.

I also worked on the first comprehensive redesign of apple.com in more than 10 years and I was one of four original contributors to the [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) web framework.
