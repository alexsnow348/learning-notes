How do companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Doordash apply AI to improve their products and processes? We put together a database of 500 case studies from 100+ companies that share practical ML use cases, including applications built with LLMs and Generative AI, and learnings from designing ML and LLM systems.

Maintained by the team behind [Evidently](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently), an open-source tool for ML and LLM evaluation.
